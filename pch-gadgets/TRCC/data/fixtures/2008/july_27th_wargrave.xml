  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      After some confusion, it was settled that the game would be played at Twyford, and Wargrave made the
      short journey to Stanlake Meadow for what proved to be the hottest day of the year so far, and
      exceptionally humid too.
      <p>
      Stand-in TRCC captain Woodman won a valuable toss, and
      elected to bat. Things began at a reasonable, if not awe-inspiring pace, as the openers settled in.
      The bowling was not too testing, and they felt comfortable out there. And indeed it was to be a long
      partnership - 32 overs before the first wicket fell with the score on 123! Support was offered by
      new batmen Fuller until he completely missed one ball that went on to strike him painfully on the
      lip, and he had to retire hurt. The innings was soon at an end after that - The final score of 186-2
      did not look too bad for such a hot day with a fairly sluggish outfield.
      <p>
      And things
      did not improve for Wargrave once they took to the crease. The openers were not straight
      line-and-length, but there were enough good balls to have the visitors looking sorry at 33-3 off 13
      overs. But middle order batsmen (some messing around with the usual order?) J Lunnon and
      &quot;Tom&quot; took the bowling apart. Sometimes a bit lucky, but mostly just good, they powered a
      succession of 4's and 6's to &amp; <em>over</em> the boundary with some excellent shots. The bowlers
      - hot and tired on such a day - had no response.
      <p>
      So the derby match goes to Wargrave
      <em>this</em> year, but just wait 'till 2009!
      <p>
      A final mention for Luke &quot;The
      Lip&quot; Fuller, who took an excellent catch on the boundary!
