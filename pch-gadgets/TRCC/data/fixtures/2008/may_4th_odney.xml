    <![CDATA[
       Overcast but warm (even humid), TRCC's 2008 season kicked off at long-time rivals Odney. 
     
      <p>
       The toss being won, Pete Woodman (standing in for TRCC captain Nic Downes who was a few
      minutes late) elected to bat. There were obvious 'cobwebs' in the Odney attack, with few balls being
      on target and many extras conceded. But the cobwebs took on <em>Indiana Jones</em> proportions with
      Twyford's batting! Runs were slow, wickets were not, often the result of some truly awful strokes
      rather than the difficulty of the bowling. Only captain Nic Downes made double figures for the
      visitors, who collapsed to an ignominious 68 all out. 
      <p>
       Odney got their turn at bat
      before the tea interval due to the swiftness of Twyford's innings, but it was not all plain sailing
      for the home club. Hackett was accurate, and was rewarded with two wickets, and there were too many
      lofted shots from Odney for their comfort. But the target was just too low. After tea the home side
      'went for it', and easily rattled off the required runs in just 15 overs. 
      <p>
       So -
      Neither team 'in the zone', but Odney coming out deserved winners.
