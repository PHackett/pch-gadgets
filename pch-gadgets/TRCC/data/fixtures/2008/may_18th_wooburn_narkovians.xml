  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Playing host for the second week running, Twyford welcomed long-time rivals Wooburn Narkovians to
      Stanlake meadow. 
      <p>
       Winning the toss, Twyford put the visitors in to bat on a
      pleasant if somewhat overcast afternoon (Turning a bit chilly later!). Things began well for
      Twyford, with runs in short supply. Hackett's bowling especially gave nothing away. The first wicket
      fell in the 8th over, and still runs would not come for Wooburn! But slowly, the batsman began to
      amass a score. R Rogers, followed by R Barker both got near to 50, with Tennant & Small making
      valuable contributions towards the end of the innings. The final score of 172 was far higher than
      seemed possible half way through the innings! Pick of the bowlers for Twyford was C Fort, taking 4
      in a penetrating spell of spin. 
      <p>
       Twyford began their turn at the crease in fine
      style, both the openers looking good. Wooburn's bowling was challenging, forcing several
      half-chances. But with the first wicket falling at a score or 59, and the seconds at 102, the home
      side thought they smelled victory! But the bowling did not let up, and the run rate could not be
      maintained. Opener Woodman, getting his second successive 50 fell in the 34th over, and then it was
      just a matter of whether Twyford could avoid being bowled out or not! But survive they did, and the
      game ended in a draw.
