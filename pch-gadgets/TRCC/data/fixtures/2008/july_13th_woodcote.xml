    <![CDATA[
      On the road for the second week running, Twyford made the trip to Woodcote in Oxfordshire
      <p>

           Winning the toss, the hosts placed Twyford in to bat. A steady start was made by Woodman and
      Benjamin with some fine boundaries flowing on what was a reasonably pacey outfield. Benjamin fell in
      the 17th over, but was replaced by Captain N Downes who powered the ball to the boundary with great
      regularity - A fine display indeed. The rest of the Twyford batsmen did not trouble the scorekeeper
      very much (Except Seymour), but the final total of 180-9 certainly gave the visitors hope - They had
      something to bowl at! Pick of the bowling for Woodcote was Topper who bowled 14 tight overs, only
      conceding 44 runs.
      <p>
      After tea, battle resumed - allbeit what turned out to be a
      rather one-sides one. Twyford bowlers were never penetrating, and the home batsmen took advantage.
      Anderson was dismissed by a great catch with the score in the 40s, but then in came Allomany (Not
      sure of the spelling of the name - Unclear in scorebook). He saw the ball as if it were the size of
      a melon, hitting boundaries with what became depressing regularity for Twyford. Never putting a foot
      wrong nor giving a single chance, he raced to his century in double quick time. It was all over in
      24 overs. 
      <p>
      So a bit of a humiliation for Twyford - There was nothing they could do
      to stem the flow of runs from a batsman in great form!
