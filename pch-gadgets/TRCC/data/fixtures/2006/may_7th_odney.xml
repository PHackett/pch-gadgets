    <![CDATA[
       Another year, another season... 
      <p>
       TRCC travelled to the delightful ground of Odney,
      in the grounds of John Lewis's management center. Trees, flowers and all that looking delightful! 
 
          <p>
       Losing the toss (A very bad loss, considering the <em>excellence</em> of the teas
      provided at this venue) Twyford were placed into bat. A verdant outfield looked as though boundaries
      were going to be hard to come by and so it proved, with the initial run-rate being agonizingly slow.
      This picked up a little after the first change of bowling but when the first wicket fell in the
      19<sup>th</sup> over, only 30 runs were on the board. However for the third wicket stand, opener
      Woodman came in to his own! Ably assisted by Smith, this pair added 99 runs, the vast majority from
      Woodman who carried his bat for a final total of 109 not out. An excellent performance for the first
      game of the season. 
      <p>
       The final total of 174-4 off 52 overs, while not huge, seemed
      pretty good given the green outfield. 
      <p>
       After tea (which the Twyford opening bowlers
      could only gaze at!), Odney came out looking confident and purposeful. Tight bowling (considering
      this was the first game of the season) kept the runs down, but never really penetrated. Griffiths
      carried his bat in some style for most of the innings before being bowled for 63, and was supported
      well by M Dickie. Others were held back by good bowling and the long grass. 
      <p>
      
      Twyford's total was never really threatened, but dismissing 10 batsmen was not on the cards either -
      The match ened in a well-fought draw.
