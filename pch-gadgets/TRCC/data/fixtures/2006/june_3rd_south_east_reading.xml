    <![CDATA[
       On what looked like a cracking batting track, the ball dominated the bat. TRCC won the toss and
      after much deliberation SERCC we put into bat. Beamish and Smith opened the bowling and immediately
      put the SERCC batsmen under pressure with aggressive line and length bowling. The first over brought
      much drama with 2 boundaries, a dislocated finger and a wicket, the prized Choudry going for 8. The
      next partnership was shortlived adding only 3 runs before Ali was caught well by Alex Neall in the
      slips off the bowling of Smith. 
      <p>
       Zaheer Abbas and A D Ali then put on a stand of 67
      with some fine hitting. A change in the bowling saw Hogarth come on at the road end and Abbas was
      trapped Plumb LWB hitting across the line. The next over saw Pacha run out after some cool fielding
      from Leigh. A D Ali was then trapped LBW by Hogarth on 46. 
      <p>
       Beamish then came back
      into the attack replacing Smith at the electric fence end. Kahn was out bizarrely hooking a wide leg
      side delivery onto his stumps. Some powerful hitting from Ashraf saw the score race along to 140
      before Leigh came onto bowl and took the last 3 wickets for 1 run and SERCC all out for 143.
      Beamish's last spell was 6-4-2-2, a stunning demonstration of fast bowling. 
      <p>
       Downes
      and Seymour opened the batting for Twyford against some aggressive and very rapid bowling from
      Choudry and Abbas. Scoring was hard and the first 7 overs only brought 11 runs. Seymour was first
      out for 2 to an inswinger from Choudry. Alex Neall then went for a duck, playing all around a
      straight one from Choudry. Leigh was next in and again went without troubling the scorers playing
      across and another straight delivery. 
      <p>
       Hogarth came in to join Downes, who had been
      watching the mayhem ensue, and the scoring came freely for a while with several boundaries coming
      along and some good running. It did'nt last long with Hogarth going caught behind on 11. George
      “Blue” Nunn was next in and showed great technique in a stand of 40 before he was bowled playing
      around a quick delivery from AD Ali. 
      <p>
       This was the last real resistance save for a
      few very well struck boundaries from Downes who then went caught behind on 49 to end TRCC's hope of
      a shock win over the div leaders. All in all, a poor batting performance saw 6 ducks and only 3
      double figure scores.
