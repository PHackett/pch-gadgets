  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Much to the annoyance of West Ham supporting Adam Smith, Hugh, standing in as skipper, won the toss
      and decided to insert the visitors on what looked to be a good bowling day. 
      <p>
       Some
      very controlled bowling from the openers contributed to a slow run rate, Pace and line from Beamish
      being well complemented by swing from Cooper. Wickets fell early and after 10 overs the visitors
      were 3 down for only 20 runs. 
      <p>
       A middle order stand of 40 helped Purley consolidate
      and look like they could post a competitive total but inspired bowling changes to bring on (Blue)
      Nunn and Hogarth saw more tight bowling and a stifled run rate. Wickets continued to come including
      2 for 3 from the rising king of spin, Baker and a well deserved one for Hogarth. The pick of the
      bowlers was Stevie B who picked up 4 for 21 off 11 overs. Purley ended up on 108 all out off 35
      overs. 
      <p>
       After a fine tea laid on by Alex, the run chase ensued. Roger and Adam
      opened and set the innings up nicely against some tight Purley bowling. Roger was first out for 12
      after some fine shots. Adam continued his shot-making from Match 1 with some nicely played
      boundaries to keep the run rate ticking over before advancing down the wicket to one and getting
      stumped for 22. Rather ironically so, as Adam had whipped the bails off at regular intervals whilst
      keeping wicket. 
      <p>
       Hogarth and Partington continued the chase being able to increase
      the run rate thanks to some loose deliveries and some big hitting. Partington departed, also stumped
      for 8 before Hugh came to the wicket to see the game home. Hogarth hit the winning six to bring up a
      half century finishing 54 no with five 4s and four 6s. A fine team performance with everyone
      contributing.
