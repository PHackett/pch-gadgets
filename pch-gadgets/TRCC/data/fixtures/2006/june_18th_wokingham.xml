  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A warm, humid but overcast day saw Wokingham Friendly travel to Twyford. Placed in to bat,
      Wokingham were made to struggle, losing their first three wickets by the eighth over with only 25 on
      the board. A fourth batsman returned to the pavilion when the score was 34, but then the tide
      turned. Ashford &amp; Sauven began to take the fight back to the home side. Sauven fell with the
      score on 89, but the Wokingham tail was long, with fine contributions from all. When tea came round,
      the visitors had amassed a total of 164 - Not bad considering where they stood early on in the
      innings! 
      <p>
       But after the previous dry weather, Twyford were confident that they
      could reach this total with the outfield so quick. Things started shakily with two Twyford batsmen
      dismissed with the score on only 15, but when Fuller joined Woodman at the crease, a fine stand took
      the total to 95 before Woodman was stumped. Fuller was joined by Downes who went on a brutal attack,
      hitting some of the largest sixes ever seen at Stanlake Meadow and placing the result beyond doubt.
      The target was reached with eight overs to spare, Fuller finishing with 65 not-out. 
      <p>
     
       A happy result for Twyford, especially considering their previous weeks drubbing. But full credit
      to Wokingham too whose younger players promised a good future.
