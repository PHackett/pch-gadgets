  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Let down by their scheduled opposition (Falklands - <b><em>Two years running now</em></b>) Twyford
      used the Conference to arrange a new match away at Penn Street - A delightful village between High
      Wycombe &amp; Amersham with not one but <em>three</em> cricket pitches within about 500 meters of
      eachother, all (apparently) opposite Pubs! The game was arranged to begin at 10:00am because there
      was some sort of association football (soccer) match on in the afternoon the many players wished to
      observe. 
      <p>
       Twyford won the toss and elected to field. This was probably the correct
      decision, but with the short, dry outfield and what turned out to be a true wicket meant that it was
      going to feel like a long time in the field for the visitors! Opening line and length was not all it
      could have been, and Penn St. made hay. But as time progressed Twyford managed to rein in the
      scoring rate, and succeeded in sending the openers back to the pavilion. But then Collinson came to
      the crease. Never looking particularly troubled by the attack he dispatched the ball to the boundary
      so often that Twyford had no answer. Good fielding from the visitors did not matter - He found the
      gaps. Ably supported by Lofty who scored 65, Collinson ended on a huge 152 not out - An excellent
      performance. 
      <p>
       Nevertheless, Twyford may have been lacking in bowling, but 10 of the
      side has performed well with the bat this season, and the large total was perhaps not completely
      beyond their reach. And indeed Woodman &amp; Benjamin started well, many boundaries flying and the
      required run-rate being achieved. Benjamin had to leave the field for a while when he top-edged a
      ball onto his forward (Nasty cut - No permanent damage). Indeed it was not until the 16<sup>th</sup>
      over when the first wicket fell - Woodman continuing his excellent season with another 50. But
      Twyford could not maintain. Disappointed batsmen returned regularly to the pavilion (Well, actually
      the garden of the Pub opposite - So at least they could drown their sorrows), unhappy that with such
      a lovely batting track they had not scored more. Only Hill - Playing his fist game in 8 years, and
      Walkland with his first (And very aggressive!) 50 for the club shone. The well deserved victory
      belonged to Penn Street. 
      <p>
       A fine time was has by all, and it was agreed that these
      two teams who met by accident through the Cricket Club Conference should repeat the fixture in the
      following years.
