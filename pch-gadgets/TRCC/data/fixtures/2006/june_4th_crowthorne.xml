  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       It's Summer - Official! 
      <p>
       Crowthorne came to Twyford on the best weekend of the
      &quot;Summer&quot; so far. A little cloud later in the afternoon, and even a light shower could not
      spoil the day. 
      <p>
       Winning the toss, Twyford were placed in the field. The innings
      opened with drama a Hackett bowled two full tosses that were each dispatched for 4, only for the
      third ball to bowl opener Ingram! Things did not improve for the visitors in the second over as
      Walkland dismissed batsman No 3. Crowthorne continued to add runs at a fair rate, but wickets were
      falling with regularity. Twice in the innings two wickets fell on consecutive balls (but no
      hat-trick was achieved). After 26 overs Crowthorne had scored 103 runs for the loss of 9 wickets.
      But the tail wagged furiously for another 9 overs bringing the final total to 146 all out. Pick of
      the bowling was Healey with 4 wickets. 
      <p>
       Twyford were more than confident that the
      target was attainable with the depth in their batting, but tight bowling from the visitors was not
      going to make it an easy matter! Runs came very slowly, and wickets fell. By the time 20 overs was
      called only 54 runs had been scored for 3 wickets, and that small total had taken 23 overs to
      achieve. The required run-rate kept mounting, as the remaining overs and wickets fell. But, with the
      main order batmen back in the pavilion, step forward Edney &amp; Walkland to take the fight back to
      the opposition. Fine boundaries from both players pushed Twyford on until the winning runs came with
      just two balls remaining in the innings - A very tight finish! 
      <p>
       An excellent
      bowling performance from Crowthorne almost rescued the game for them, especially noteworthy being
      Flood only conceded 25 runs in 15 overs. However, the visitors total was just too small and Twyford
      enjoyed their victory!
