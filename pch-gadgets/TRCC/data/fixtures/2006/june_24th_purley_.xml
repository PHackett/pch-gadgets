  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The very picturesque setting of Yattendon was the scene for a match dominated by the bat. Winning
      the toss TRCC decided to bat and go for max batting points in order to make ground on the teams
      above. All started well but went downhill fast when Nathan Eddy and Adam Smith both went scoring 8
      to leave us on 20 for 2 in the 5th over. 
      <p>
       Hogarth and Leigh steadied the ship with
      a stand of 45 before Leigh was caught behind, then Jones came in and played a swashbuckling 41
      smashing the ball to all parts and hitting the biggest six of the day. Changes in the bowling saw
      the runs continue to pile up. A stand of 61 between Hogarth and Chris Smith saw the score top 200
      before Hogarth top edged and was caught behind for a career-best 85. Smith continued to score
      boundaries and, ably assisted by Baker and Cooper, marshalled the score along to a seasons best of
      239. Special mention should go to David Lincoln, a 16-year-old bowler for for Purley who kept
      charging in all innings finishing with 3 for 33 off 15 overs. 
      <p>
       After an unrivalled
      tea, the Purley innings started promisingly for TRCC with the key wicket of Hinds with the score on
      11. Purley consolidated and Buck and Glossop shared a stand of 75 though they were quickly falling
      behind the required rate to win the match. Wickets were proving elusive so Baker was thrown the ball
      and he immediately came up with 2 wickets to peg purley back and give hope. Some good catching by
      Beamish and Baker kept the pressure on but the overs ran out and the match ended in a winning draw
      for TRCC, a disappointing ending after a good batting performance.
