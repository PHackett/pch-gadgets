    <![CDATA[
       In another high scoring game Twyford slipped to defeat with one ball remaining. Asked to bat on a
      worn and sloping wicket that played better than expected Twyford got off to an electric start as
      Benjamin went off like an express train, exquisitely timing the plentiful supply of short balls. Tom
      Fort in a rich vein of form moved steadily to a half centurty and then added impetus with some sixes
      off the slow bowling. He was well supported by the late middle order, which included a six from
      elder brother James that the local Blacksmith would have purred over, and a plentiful supply of
      extras as Twyford posted a challenging 193 for 8. 
      <p>
       Bledlow made a good start,
      helped by some wayward bowling from Hackett. At the other end however Beamish was bowling well and
      made an early breakthrough. The side thought he also had the no. 3 caught behind but the umpire saw
      it as off the pad. This and a near miss in the slips off Downes as Floyd chased a wide one proved
      crucial. Floyd stayed at the crease until the end and paced the ininngs through to a tight but well
      judged finish. By the close the Twyford fielding was looking very much in keeping with the steam
      trains that chuffed gently back and forth at the pavilion end. It reminded one of a bygone era where
      everything moved more slowly albeit with great and majestic purpose. It was toot toot Twyford!
