  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Twyford, playing at the beautiful Eversley ground for the first time, were put in to bat. Hall and
      Seymour put on 51 for the fist wicket and then Seymour and Tom Fort 106 for the second wicket.
      Seymour was particularly savage on the fast, short leg side balls that came his way and Fort danced
      down the wicket to the slow bowlers when they came on, both making excellent half centuries. With
      both out in quick succession the innings collapsed from 157-1 to 200 all out. 
      <p>
      
      Eversley started well and at 108-1 it looked as though the score would be within their range. Tom
      Fort took a couple of wickets to even things up and then took a quite stunning catch off his own
      bowling to dismiss opener Cummings who had moved on to an aggressive and very assured 53. This was a
      turning point in the game as Twyford now poured on the pressure. It was not to be however and
      although Fort had the exceptional figures of 10 overs, 5 maidens, 6 wickets for 10 runs the last two
      wickets were not to be prised out and an excellent game played in great spirit ended in draw.
