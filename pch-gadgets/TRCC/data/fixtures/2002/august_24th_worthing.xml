  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A grand place play, once a venue for the County team and where on the main pitch Pete could
      remember as a boy watching Ted Dexter play. 
      <p>
       Worthing won the toss and elected to
      bat but were soon regretting their decision as Paul Hackett made the ball swing from one end and
      Stewart Wren kept things tight at the other. . Worthing's exuberant batsmen did not have the
      concentration to knuckle down and with some generous lbw decisions by their umpires they were really
      struggling at 64 for 5. Only Flower an, occasional in Worthing's seconds, had the patience to allow
      his innings to blossom and with his shepherding of the tail put some respectability in a final score
      of 158. Paul's best bowling of the season, bounce as well as controlled swing brought him a return
      of 6 for 41. 
      <p>
       With the shine off of the ball and the pitch a good one Woodman and
      Seymour put on 64 for the first wicket and Twyford were in firm control of the game. 30 from Wren
      and good support from the middle order saw the side home for the loss of 5 wickets. Although it went
      to the last over the result was never really in doubt despite Downes pulling up lame with 10 runs
      still needed. A good win and a great start to the tour. 
      <p>
       Won by 5 wickets
