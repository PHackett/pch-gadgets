    <![CDATA[
       Twyford paid their first visit to the beautiful Falkland ground and were inspired by the setting. A
      much weakened Twyford inserted Falkland on a good track. After an initially quick start by Falkland,
      Hackett and Beamish both got the new ball to swing away and made life very difficult for the
      batsmen, both had sharp chances put down. At 74 for 3 a good score looked in prospect but a fragile
      tail with several juniors in it dramatically collapsed. The innings finished on 89 with the last 6
      wickets falling in 16 balls. Wren took 3 for 10 from 6 overs hitting the stumps twice and nearly
      taking a hat trick and Downes took 3 for 9 from 2 overs including 2 catches off his own bowling.

       In reply Twyford made good progress despite the early loss of Greenfield. 15 year old
      Philip Hoy starred with 32 in only his second senior game displaying a fine temperament for the big
      occasion. He put on 69 for the second wicket with skipper Nic Downes who was particularly savage on
      anything short and who finished unbeaten on 38 as Twyford secured an 8 wicket victory.
