  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       On a hot & muggy day with actual &quot;exercise&quot; causing buckets of sweat to flow, Twyford
      welcomed Greys Green to Stanlake Meadow in Twyford. Winning the toss, the visitors surprised &amp;
      delighted the home side by opting to field first in the oppressive atmosphere. 
      <p>
      
      Twyford took some time to get into their stride. Although the openers were not in any danger of
      dismissal, runs came slowly - But they came. It took 23 overs for the first wicket to fall with the
      score on 59, and the home side pressed on, avoiding the seemingly inevitable collapse that has
      dogged recent games for them. Fuller &amp; Hill provided a much needed spurt of runs - TRCC
      finishing on 157 for 6. Greys bowlers had in the main been pretty tight, but fielding was punishing
      work that day! 
      <p>
       So, despite the modest total, Twyford felt pretty relaxed as they
      took their turn in the field. And with Cooper taking two early wickets in his opening spell, their
      confidence increased. But Greys were in the match to win! First Macleod and then Shafdat joined
      Howell at the crease as he went on to an undefeated 84 - An excellent performance especially
      considering the relative paucity of boundaries. But the run rate would not drop, although Greys did
      keep up with it. The match went to the last over - The winning 4 being hit with just two balls to
      spare. 
      <p>
       Disappointment then once more for Twyford. But a fine, close match with a
      nail-biting climax and superb, sporting opposition - There was no complaining.
