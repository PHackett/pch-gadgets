    <![CDATA[
       The great wheel of time turns, and once more the brave warriors of Twyford must do battle with the
      forces of <em>darkness</em>... 
      <p>
       Thus, gentle reader, TRCC found themselves
      travelling far afied to the fine ground of Welford Park on a sunny day, far better than we deserve
      for such an early time in the season. Global warming - Bring it on! Placed in the field, the creaky
      bones of the visitors were nervous - Had they overdone it the previous night? Were they just too
      damn old to pretend that they could still 'perform'? A few wayward balls in the opening 2 overs gave
      pause for concern, but needlessly so! Hackett struck twice in his second over, then again the
      following one, and the home side were reeling! Sharp fielding (boy was it obvious we had a lot of
      Saturday players in the side!) and continued fine bolwing from Green and Cooper severely punished
      Welford, who sunk to 71 all out. 
      <p>
       As for Twyford's turn at the crease, Woodman
      proved he was still alive with a workman-like performance ot score 17, while Eddy just took the
      bolwing apart. It was all over after just 16.4 overs. 
      <p>
       So, a good start for
      Twyford, played at a fabulously beautiful ground in excellent weather with friendly, sporting hosts.
      That'll do for me... 
      <p>
       Also, a special event today when Paul Hackett broke <span
      class='ScorecardSm'>300</span> wickets for the club - Well done me!
