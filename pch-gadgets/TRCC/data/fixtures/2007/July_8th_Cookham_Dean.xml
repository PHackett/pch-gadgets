  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       After the incessant rain of the past few weeks, it was with great relief that Twyford were able to
      welcome Cookham Dean to the Stanlake Meadow ground for a game of Cricket! 
      <p>
       The home
      side batted first, and although the openers looked reasonably confident, the runs were not coming.
      When the first wicket fell in the 18<sup>th</sup> over only 43 were on the board, due to a
      combination of a sluggish wicket, good bowling, and a less than attacking effort from the batsmen!
      Things improved a little for the home side with N Downes, Edney &amp; J Fort speeding thing up, but
      the final score of 131 for 7 off 41 overs looked anaemic. Pick of the bowling for Cookham was
      Farnborough, who coming in at the tail of the innings managed to take 3 wickets for only 7 runs. 
  
         <p>
       But the visitors were not to find the result clear cut! Accurate bowling, especially
      from Hackett who bowled for almost the entire innings, saw wickets tumble early. A recovery was
      spearheaded by Evans, but then a second flurry of wickets saw Cookham in trouble on 83-7. As the 20
      overs counted down, it was nip-and-tuck, but a fighting innings by Gay Jnr. who ended on an
      undefeated 37 eventually saw the visitors to victory with only 8 balls remaining in the match. 
    
       <p>
       Exciting stuff - Tense to the end and played with great spirit by both sides.
