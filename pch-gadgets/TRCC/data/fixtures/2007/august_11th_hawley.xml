  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A bright sunny day and a rock hard pitch said &quot;Win the toss, Bat first&quot;. This was duly
      done by Stevie G and we anticipated a 35 pointer. Ken and Gers opened the innings and set off at a
      cracking pace of well over 6 per over with the 50 coming up in the 9th over. Some wayward bowling
      and great shots saw the rate maintained until Gers got himself out on 38 with the score on 89. Nath
      joined in the fun quickly seeing the ball 'very big' and launching into some boundaries. On 49 Ken
      decided to dance out of his crease and was duly stumped, denying himself the chance of a consecutive
      half century. 
      <p>
       Hogarth and Eddy then took on the scoring and saw TRCC past the 175
      mark for max points before Hogarth found a new way of getting himself out by missing a 'little
      tickle down the legside' and getting a plumb LBW from Rog. The remaining wickets fell fairly
      regularly after that but not before we had all witnessed a blistering, chanceless 151 not out from
      Nathan including 25 fours and 4 sixes, with the kind of shots most of us dream of playing. TRCC
      declared the innings after 40 overs with the score 325 - 7. 
      <p>
       After a fine tea TRCC
      took the field and could immediately put Hawley under pressure with a very attacking field. Keeping
      he old ball, Spence opened the bowling with Stevie G and bowled very tightly to restrict the batsmen
      to the odd single here and there. As usual the very tight fielding meant there were no easy run and
      the scoreboard crept along at about a run per over. The new ball was duly taken by Gerwyn and Stevie
      G upon which wickets began to fall at a regular rate with both of them picking up 3 wickets for 11
      and 10 runs respectively. The younger members of the team, Ant Green and Karl Cochrane, were then
      thrown the ball to clean up the tail, Ant bowled beautifully in his 2 over and really had Dickinson
      in trouble with some tight line and length. The glory however went to Karl with 2 great balls that
      produced stumpings for his old man. Stumped K Cochrane, Bowled K Cochrane jnr. Good show allround.
      TRCC 35 points, Hawley 3 points.
