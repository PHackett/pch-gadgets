  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A heavy, overcast sky - grey but not threatening rain - greeted Moulsford as they arrived at
      Stanlake Meadow recreation field to take on the hosts Twyford. Winning the toss, the home side
      elected to bat. 
      <p>
       From the outset, the home side was in deep trouble. The opening
      attack of White and Spackman was accurate, testing the batsmen on every ball. This, combined with
      some lamentable strokes from Twyford soon had the home side reeling at 6 for 4 wickets after only 4
      overs. It looked like we were going to get to the pub nice and early that afternoon! But with Downes
      joining Woodman at the crease the descent into total ignominy was halted. Both played fine innings,
      their final stand of 100 before Downes was bowled saving Twyford from total humiliation. But the
      excellent bowling, especially from Spackman who ended with 17 for 5 off 13 overs, meant that
      Moulsford only required 128 to win, a seemingly straightforward target. 
      <p>
       Moulsford
      began well, but for their innings too, it was to be the bowlers who were to dominate. In his
      3<sup>rd</sup> over Hackett struck twice, and then Benson dismissed A White in the next over.
      Moulsford recovered from these early shocks, taking the score on to 63 by the 16<sup>th</sup> over,
      firmly back in the driving seat. Then the Captain Downes struck, taking 2 wickets in <em>his</em>
      3<sup>rd</sup> over, and the pressure mounted once more on Moulsford! Good fielding kept runs at a
      premium, while Hackett and Downes relentlessly kept up an accurate attack. But Moulsford were by no
      means out of it, and with 8 overs remaining needed only 35 runs for victory with 4 wickets in hand.
      Then Downes had Singh stumped after a determined 23, and Moulsford's tail finally collapsed - The
      last three wickets falling for just 4 runs. Hackett ended with the fine figures of 15 overs, 7
      maidens, 18 for 3, while Downes had his best figures since 2001 taking 6 wickets for 41 runs. 
     
      <p>
       An exciting game whose result was in doubt right to the end, and a spirited performance
      from Twyford!
