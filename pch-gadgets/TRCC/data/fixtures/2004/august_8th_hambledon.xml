  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       For the third week running Twyford were on the road, this time visiting the delightful village of
      Hambledon. Clouds had gathered, hiding the bright hot sun we had seen in the morning. This was
      appreciated as even with the overcast sky the temperature &amp; humidity made any physical exertion
      a sweaty &amp; tiring experience. 
      <p>
       Twyford began batting, and were from the start
      pinned down by accurate bowling from Walker &amp; Hanson. Runs simply would not come, frustrating
      the Twyford openers. The first payoff for Hambledon came in only the 4<sup>th</sup> over when
      Woodman was trapped LBW. Worse was to follow for Twyford, who were soon reeling at 38-5 off 18
      overs. But Hall was still at the crease, and aided by J Fort and later Edney, managed to score a
      highly useful 49 before being caught off Tilbury. Tail ender Cochrane provided a spirited 37 not
      out, but the final Twyford total of 135, which took 39 overs to amass, looked far too small. 
     
      <p>
       And Twyford's bowlers failed <em><u>miserably</u></em> to rise to the challenge. Cochrane
      alone managed to achieve a consistent line &amp; length and was rewarded with the only 2 wickets
      that Twyford were to take. Hambledon, mean while, took full advantage of the other bowlers &amp; the
      many dropped catches. Rosier hit a surefooted 41, while French reached the boundary many times in
      his 60 not out. It was all over very quickly - Hambledon needing a mere 23 overs to overtake
      Twyford's total. 
      <p>
       Still, the hosts were very gracious and sporting in their victory
      and Twyford had only themselves to blame - Revenge next year!
