  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The summer seemed to have begun in earnest, as Greys Green played host to Twyford on a glorious
      summer's day. 
      <p>
       Put into bat, Twyford began their innings at a fine pace with the
      ball being dispatched to the short Greys Green boundary with, for Twyford, amazing regularity!
      Benson fell in the 8<sup>th</sup> over, bowled by Blincowe, but T Fort replaced him, and the runs
      continued. However, when two more wickets had fallen by the 22<sup>nd</sup> over, the bowlers took
      over. Runs became scarce but wickets less so. C Evans and A Neall provided resistance to the
      bowling, but the rest of the Twyford batting hardly troubled the scorers, with Blincowe ending up
      with 5 for 53. The final total of 153 looked far too small. 
      <p>
       Greys Green started in
      the same manner as Twyford, scoring at more than 4 an over for the first 10 overs. But 3 more overs
      saw 3 wickets fall, the best being a superb catch in the slips by T Fort. This slowed the runs, but
      not stop them. Greys Green seemed cruising to a easy victory. But then bowler D Downes (Who ended up
      taking 6 wickets for 41) found his length, and the tide swung Twyford's way. Greys were eventually
      reduced to 140 for 9, but the tail hung on, resisting the best that Twyford could throw at them. The
      eventual draw seemed like a fair result for the game. 
      <p>
       A rather chilling postscript
      was the helicopter that we had observed throughout most of the game, hovering over the village of
      Highmoor Cross only two miles away. Only later did we discover its sad significance.
