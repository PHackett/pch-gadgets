  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A grey, overcast day, but with none of the promised torrential downpours saw Twyford travelling far
      afield to Amersham Hill. 
      <p>
       Amersham Hill were first in to bat, and with loose
      bowling from the Twyford the openers made hay! Their progress was arrested early in the innings as
      Kewell &amp; Minear were caught, but the bowlers just could not find their line and length. Runs
      flowed swiftly from the bat, especially that of Berns, and by the end of the 27<sup>th</sup> over
      they had amassed 171 for just 4 wickets - well above 6 per over. 
      <p>
       Twyford's bowlers
      then managed to stem the haemorrhage of runs, limiting Amersham to 205 all out, the pick of the
      bowling being Dawson who took 5 wickets. 
      <p>
       Unfortunately, Twyford's batsmen fared no
      better than their bowlers to begin with. In no time at all, some lamentable strokeplay saw the
      visitors stumble to 38-7 off bowling which while competent, was not as threatening as the score
      suggested. All was lost for Twyford, but at least the tail managed to push the score on to over 100
      before the inevitable defeat. The only highlight for Twyford was the number 10, Beamish, whose score
      of 21 was a personal best. For Amersham Hill it was the bowling of M Joseph that stood out, managing
      to take 5-29. 
      <p>
       But still, we were glad to be able to get a game in despite the
      forecast, and the hosts were very gracious in victory!
