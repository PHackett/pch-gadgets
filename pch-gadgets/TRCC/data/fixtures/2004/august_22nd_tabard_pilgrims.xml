  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       At home for the first time in 5 weeks, Twyford welcomed the travelling side of Tabard Pilgrims to
      Stanlake Meadow. The rain, so prevalent a feature of the past week and predicted for the match day
      itself, held off and a full afternoon of play was possible. 
      <p>
       Twyford elected to
      bat, but were soon ruing that decision. The outfield was well trimmed, but the wicket was
      &quot;sticky&quot; with the ball coming on to the bat extremely slowly. This made scoring shots
      difficult, and the mis-timing of shots more likely - but also it must be noted that the opening
      bowlers Tipple &amp; Clarence kept things extremely tight. After only 6 overs Twyford had lost 2
      wickets, and as the innings progressed the run rate stayed below 2 per over for the first 22 overs.
      Benjamin &amp; Downes provided the mainstay of the Twyford innings, however the run rate never got
      above 3 per over. All the Tabard bowlers acquitted themselves well, and Twyford's final total of 122
      seemed extremely vulnerable. 
      <p>
       But the batting conditions were not to prove to
      Tabard's liking either. Accurate opening spells from Hackett &amp; Beamish restricted the run rate
      to less that 3 per over for the first 18 overs, and saw 4 wickets fall. But the visitor's dug in,
      and riding their luck (&amp; dropped catches) pressed towards the winning total. With so few runs
      required for victory, and without the needed breakthrough for Twyford, victory was secured for
      Tabard in the 38<sup>th</sup> over. 
      <p>
       A few more runs and a bit more luck - It could
      have all been different! Not much separated the teams, and Twyford can take heart from a gutsy
      performance.
