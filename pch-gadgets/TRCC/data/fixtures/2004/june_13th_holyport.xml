  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       On the hottest day of the year so far, Twyford played host to Holyport at Stanlake Meadow. Winning
      the toss, Twyford captain Nic Downes elected to bat. 
      <p>
       A less auspicious start would
      scarce have been possible, with Woodman clean bowled off the first ball of the innings. The opening
      bowlers Barney and Head kept the pressure up and by the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> over Twyford were
      reeling at 19 for 3. But relief for the batting side came with Dunsford and Cochrane put together an
      inspired and exciting partnership of 77, lifting Twyford out of the doldrums. And so the form
      continued throughout the rest of the batting order, with all contributing runs. However, Holyport
      were bowling tightly, keeping runs at a premium. The final total of 168 for 8 looked too small with
      the fast outfield parched after the recent weather. 
      <p>
       And so it was to prove.
      Holyport's openers Dunn and Davies spent the first two overs getting ready, and then unleashed a
      barrage of boundaries. Punishing anything overpitched or slightly off line, they scored at almost 6
      an over for the first 15 overs, the frantic progress slowed only when the very much in-form Davies
      was caught on the boundary for 60. Dunn was dismissed the following over, but the writing was on the
      wall. Under the bright sun Twyford's bowlers were unable to apply sufficient pressure, and the
      winning runs came in the 30<sup>th</sup> over. 
      <p>
       A well deserved win for Holyport,
      though Twyford should not be too discouraged by their performance. 
      <p>
       Of course,
      worse was to follow down the public house afterwards, with the England football team unable to
      emulate the success of their cricketing counterparts!
