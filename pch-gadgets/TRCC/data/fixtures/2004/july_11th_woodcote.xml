  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A threatening overcast day, very ugly for mid-July, saw Twyford make the journey to Woodcote on the
      weekend of the Woodcote steam rally (The bowling was interrupted for &quot;Biplanes doing aerobatic
      stunts behind the bowlers arm&quot;! 
      <p>
       Woodcote began batting, and immediately
      demonstrated that they intended to score at a rate, with Topham hitting the biggest six that I, the
      unfortunate bowler, had ever seen, off only the second ball of the innings. Woodcote tried to
      continue in the same vein, but Twyford's openers were putting the ball on the spot with the
      inevitable result that wickets began to fall. After 18 overs the home team had been reduced to 52
      for 4, and Twyford were feeling on top of the game. But Woodcote had depth of batting, and were
      going to show it in a forthright manner! Both Lloyd and Warfield scored 48 each, and Knot hit a
      superb 94. At the end of the innings, Woodcote's final total of 245 looked very daunting. 
     
      <p>
       Twyford began at a fine lick, seeming at ease with the pacy Woodcote attack. But things
      were not to go the batting side's way. 3 consecutive overs saw 3 wickets fall, and from then on the
      run rate never threatened the Woodcote total. Indeed, wickets kept falling cheaply, and when the 20
      overs countdown began, Twyford were in dire straits at 68 for 6. Twyford lost two more wickets, but
      then Dunsford and Walkland dug in, refusing to budge. For 15 overs they held out, Dunsford finishing
      on 46 and Walkland 25 - Twyford has achieved an unexpected, and perhaps somewhat undeserved draw.
