  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A beautiful sun-drenched morning gave way to a grey, overcast afternoon complete with drizzle, as
      Twyford travelled to nearby rivals Wargrave for the local derby. 
      <p>
       Wargrave batted
      first, starting in confident form on a fine batting track with a fast outfield. But accurate bowling
      from Twyford's openers, Hackett being especially testing, kept runs to a minimum. Progress was slow
      for Wargrave, managing to amass only 99 runs off the first 25 overs with the loss of 3 wickets. But
      then Wargrave regular M Woods started to hit out, accelerating the run rate on his way to an
      exciting 56. When he fell, run out with the score on 171, the rest of the tail were unable to add
      runs quickly, restricted by another fine bowling performance form Downes. The final total of 209 for
      9 looked eminently gettable to the men of Twyford. 
      <p>
       In reply, a swift start was
      made by Woodman and Seymour, scoring at almost 5 runs per over for the first 11 overs. But in the
      12<sup>th</sup> over Owen struck twice, putting a break on Twyford's progress. The runs kept
      mounting, but the bowling was difficult to get away, and the required run rate began to grow. At the
      same time, wickets continued to fall - the pick being a superb caught-and-bowled by Norris.
      Eventually it was not a case of Twyford cruising to victory, but of hoping to avoid defeat! But the
      visitors held out, and when the overs ran out Twyford were 19 short of victory with only the single
      wicket remaining.
