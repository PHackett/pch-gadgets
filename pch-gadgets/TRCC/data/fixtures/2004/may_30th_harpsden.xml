  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       With the weather forecast looking bleak, Twyford played hosts to Harpsden at Stanlake Meadows. 
   
        <p>
       Winning the toss, the early morning rain dictated that the Twyford captain Tom Fort
      would put Harpsden into bat. This done, the expected difficulties for the batsmen did not come to
      pass. The openers Urd and particularly Hodgekiss attacked every loose ball with venom, the runs
      mounting with rapidity. Hodgekiss was eventually out when a straight full toss went to his head, but
      then the rain that had been threatening fell, and the teams retreated to the pavilion. 
      <p>
  
          A hour later play was able to resume, as did the flow of runs. A Norton hit an unbeaten 69 to
      take Harpsden to a total of 161 off over only 29 overs. There was drama too when bowler Cochrane was
      hit square on the head from a throw from the outfield. A horrible sound like a coconut being struck,
      and he fell to the floor. He was lead off, but aside from a "Duck's Egg" lump on his head made a
      full recovery and was able to bat later. 
      <p>
       In reply, Twyford started in fine form,
      runs flowing from Benson's bat. But the bowling from Harpsden was accurate, and in the eighth over
      the first wicket fell when Benson was bowled by Gould. The ship was steadied when Seymour joined
      opener Woodman, but the runs were coming too slow. Woodman fell in the 17<sup>th</sup> over, then
      Seymour was run out off a no-ball with the score on only 64. The Twyford tail all followed meekly,
      with the exception of Cochrane who scored a valiant 26 before being last man out with the score on
      100. 
      <p>
       A well deserved victory to Harpsden, and plenty for Twyford to mull over
      regarding their performance.
