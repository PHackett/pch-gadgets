  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Another glorious summer's day saw Twyford and Ruscombe Cricket Club travelling to Moulsford, where
      they were put in to bat by the home team. A solid opening by Woodman and Benjamin saw the score to
      the 50 mark before the first wicket fell, despite some naggingly accurate bowling from Holland and
      Davies. Only one more wicket was to fall, that of Benjamin with the score on 75, leaving Wren and T
      Fort to post an impressive stand of 121 - Wren continuing his excellent form, and T Fort posting his
      best score of the season. 
      <p>
       Moulsford were soon reeling when in the first over,
      Beamish got a ball to rise sharply and had Cox caught behind. Worse was to follow, with the home
      side at 13 for 2 by the fifth over. But then Parkes and Davy pulled Moulsford back into the game
      with a spirited and attacking stand of 58. When Parkes fell with the score on 71 Holland and Ayres
      provided excellent support for Davy with stands of 48 and 38. Twyford, who had seemed to have had
      victory in their hands at the start of the innings had to settle for a draw, unable to break through
      Moulsford's resolute batting line-up
