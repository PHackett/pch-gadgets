  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       We arrived at Petwork Park unable to contain our enthusiasm - Could this be the year that we
      actually get to complete a game against Petworth, after the rain we had been faced with on the
      previous two tours? The answer appeared to be yes - Sort of. While the day was bright and fine, the
      location beautiful with wild deer with huge antlers grazing in the distance, Petwork had only been
      able to rustle up 4 players. But all was by no means lost as there were 15 Twyford players available
      on the day. Eventually two teams were arranged, Twyford having 10 men (Captained by C Evans), and
      the augmented Petworth team having 9. A limited overs game of 35 overs, each bowler having a maximum
      of 7 overs each was agreed. All the visitors were looking forward to matching themselves against
      other TRCC players! 
      <p>
       Twyford batted first, and runs flew from the bat. J Fort and R
      Seymour gave a great start reaching 47 before their partnership was broken. More was to follow from
      T Fort, Wren and Knight as Twyford powered towards just shy of the 200 mark. For Petworth, the
      bowling star was undoubtedly D Evans claiming 4 wickets, including the much prized one his brother!
      
      <p>
       Twyford were comfortable with this total, a bit more would have been nice, but
      surely it would be enough to defeat the undisciplined rabble that was the nine men of Petworth? Or
      would it....? 
      <p>
       A fine start from Petworth was cut short by Hackett, trapping
      Woodman LBW (Really Pete - It <em>was</em> plumb), quickly followed by Wakeford caught off the
      bowling of Beamish. But Greal powered on, getting fine support from Neall and then later N Downes,
      who really punished the short ball. Most of the Twyford bowling was fairly loose, with the exception
      of C Evans, who bowled like a man possessed. Unfortunately, he also bowled like a man who had as
      much luck as you would expect from someone who had, just for the fun of it, kicked a leprechaun to
      death the previous day. The number of balls that just missed the bat and/or stumps was
      disheartening. Insult was added to injury when after his spell Seymour came on to bowl and took the
      wicket of D Evans with a ball so wide, no one was quite sure how he managed to get a bat on it. 
   
        <p>
       It all came down to the last over, with Petworth needing 7 to win. N Downes knocked 6
      in the first 3 balls before being bowled (Much to enjoyment of Hackett). Petworth then snatched a
      quickly run bye off the next ball to win the match. 
      <p>
       Who was the daddy...? Not
      Twyford on this occasion!
