    <![CDATA[
       Third match on three on the tour, two defeats behind us, Twyford really wanted a victory here, but
      were well aware of the strength of the team we were to face. 
      <p>
       Put in to bat,
      Twyford's woes begin in only the third over with Woodman bowled by Batistica. But Seymour and Wren
      looked good together, both playing fluent strokes. The batsmen looked confident with runs coming
      quickly on this small ground with a fast outfield. But the required large score was not forthcoming.
      Seymour, Wren and T Fort all fell when over-confident shots were caught. The inevitable collapse
      followed quickly, falling from 101-3 to 131 all out. Only 3 batsmen made double figures, the other 8
      players amassing a feeble 19 runs combined. 
      <p>
       131 was never enough, and East Preston
      pushed this truth home quickly. They knew their home ground well, and looked confident at the
      crease. Loose bowling was once again a problem for Twyford, with N Downes being the only bright
      spot. For East Preson, Rackham hit a fine unbeaten 56 to help his team cruise to an easy victory in
      only 20 overs.
