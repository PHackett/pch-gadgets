       <b><font color='red'>Feelin' hot, hot, hot!</font></b> 
      <p>
       What an afternoon greeted
      Twyford as they travelled to their hosts Moulsford. By far the hottest day of the year, and hardly a
      cloud in sight. The sloping outfield and the parched grass promised a great bounty for the batsmen!
      
      <p>
       Winning the toss, there was no surprise when Moulsford placed Twyford in the
      field. And Twyford's opening overs vindicated the decision, with loose bowling and many extras being
      given away. Eventually Hackett and Walkland found their line and length, and the run rate began to
      slow. But openers Hermon and Hobbs were showing no sign of weakness, and looked comfortable. It was
      only with the first change of bowlers that Twyford got a breakthrough when Downes had Hermon LBW.
      And although the runs kept mounting, Hobbs with an excellent 63 being the pick for Moulsford, they
      were not mounting as quickly as might have been anticipated given the speed of the outfield. At the
      end of the 35 overs, 167 looked extremely 'gettable' to Twyford. For the visitors, captain Nick
      Downes was the star bowler with 4 wickets to hit credit. 
      <p>
       Twyford's innings began
      well, but soon ran in to trouble with the first 3 batsmen back in the pavilion by the
      11<sup>th</sup> over with only 44 on the board. Cochrane and Benson came to Twyford's rescue, and
      swung the tide back towards the visitors with well-chosen shots, helped by bowling that often was
      far from a length. Then Moulsford's Hobbs struck 3 times in two overs, and once again the games was
      in the balance. But quick scoring from the tail managed to bring Twyford home to victory with overs
      to spare. 
      <p>
       What a day! You don't get many of these during your own personal
      innings, where the weather is perfect and you get to play the game you love all afternoon. Cherish
      them!
