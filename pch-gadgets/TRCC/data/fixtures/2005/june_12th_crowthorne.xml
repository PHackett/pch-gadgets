  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       It was a dull cold day in June and the clocks were striking 14, as the home side of Twyford
      welcomed Crowthorne to their ground. Twyford began in the field, with the opening bowlers Hackett
      and Cochrane keeping runs to a premium. This was especially impressive as when the batsmen did
      connect with a shot, the ball almost inevitably raced away over the fast outfield for 4. 
      <p>

            Smith-Gander &amp; Hampshire fell victim to Cochrane in early overs, soon followed by Mac. But
      that was where the home sides successes ended. Fine batting from N Stent, and an excellent knock
      from Chatters saw the runs mount ever more quickly, though they were helped by some dropped catches.
      
      <p>
       But with the fast outfield, the innings total of 181 looked modest - Surely
      attainable by Twyford. 
      <p>
       Twyford raced to a quick start from the openers Woodman and
      Martin, once more with the aid of dropped catches. After only 20 overs the home side were on 86
      without loss. Only Buckett from Crowthorne managed to rein back the flow of runs, and was eventually
      rewarded with the wickets of the openers. But Seymour &amp; Cochrane kept the runs coming. In the
      end, the winning runs came off two wides, Twyford were home with three overs to spare.
