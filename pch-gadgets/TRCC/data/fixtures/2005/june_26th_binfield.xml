  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Using the Conference Twyford picked up a fixture at local club Binfield. The home side won the toss
      and as the sun had come out strongly at lunchtime they had no hesitation in choosing to bat first. A
      hard fast lively wicket was used well by the Twyford openers Beamish and Walkland and while the ball
      when hit raced into the big outfield, wickets were picked up regularly and at one stage Binfield
      were 76 for 5. Edgington and Goddard were rebuilding the innings and feasting on the slow bowling of
      Twyford skipper Downes when terrific work from keeper Dunsford saw him scamble down the leg side
      gather and throw the stumps down to leave the returning Edgington stranded. Goddard continued to hit
      our but Cochrane on for a second spell all but wrapped the innings up with 2 quick wickets. Twyford
      had bowled and fielded really well and the the score of 162 represented a disappointment for
      Binfield. 
      <p>
       Woodman and Seymour gave Twyford a great start with an opening stand of
      64 and when they were both out Benson took up the running with some clean hitting, using the big
      spaces in the outfield. He went on to make his maiden 50 for the club and although out with 10 runs
      needed from the last 2 overs there were some wise old heads in the middle order to see home Twyford
      home with 2 balls to spare. A terrific all round performance and a thoroughly well deserved victory,
      Binfield's first Sunday defeat of the season.
