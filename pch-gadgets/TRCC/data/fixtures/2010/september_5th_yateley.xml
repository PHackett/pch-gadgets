  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      At short notice, after being let down by the arranged opposition, a new fixture was arranged and
      Twyford made their way to the well-appointed ground of Yateley. The visitors were short of bowling
      talent, so a timely win of the toss by captain H Fort was welcomed, and Yateley were put in the
      field.
      <p>
      Despite some recent rain the ball fairly flew off the bat for four in the
      first scoring shot of the match. But the visitors were soon in trouble with a combination of loose,
      unnecessary shots and accurate bowling from Yateley. Indeed, Twyford's fortunes were not to improve
      - Only T Fort managed a respectable 49. As to the rest, just one other reached double figures. 108
      for 9 at tea - Not an impressive total on a predictable (if a little slow) track. But praise also
      the the home side. Seven bowlers were used, most of them colts. All showed accuracy and stamina in
      their deliveries.
      <p>
      So as Yateley started their innings, Twyford were heavy of heart.
      And indeed, the home side began by showing how you really <em>should</em> bat on that square! But
      then Hackett found both line &amp; length, and began to test the batsmen. The home side were on
      39-3, then soon 54-5! The game was not a lost cause after all! But Yateley's L Garvier, young as he
      was, stuck to the task at hand. Defending solidly, taking runs when possible, and ably assisted by J
      Muir, they pushed the score ever onwards. Victory was finally achieved by the home side - But fine
      fielding &amp; bowling meant that it took them 30 overs to do so. Kudos also to N Downes, who bowled
      throughout the innings, taking 2 wickets in the process. 
      <p>
      Not TRCC's finest hour
      batting-wise, but great spirit was shown in the field. An, a great time was had by all. We shall
      definitely be making Yateley a more permanent fixture in the coming seasons!
