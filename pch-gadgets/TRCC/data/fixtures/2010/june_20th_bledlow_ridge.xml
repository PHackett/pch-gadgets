  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      A beautiful day, beginning with a fairly stiff breeze from the North-East which soon mellowed to
      leave the perfect afternoon, and Twyford welcomed long term adversaries Bledlow Ridge to the
      Stanlake Meadow ground. With a a dry, true square and a freshly cut outfield, Twyford were placed in
      to bat by the oppo. 
      <p>
      The home team began with some confidence, the square playing
      true and the outfield making the fielders run. The early loss of Woodman was a blow, but his
      replacements a the crease kept the runs flowing at 4 per over, with the occasional expensive over
      mixed in. The bowling was accurate enough, but the pitch gave no help to Bledlow. Special mention,
      however, to J Easton, who at the tender age of 12 opened his spell with a wicket maiden, and kept
      the runs in check. The final score of 177 did not seem enough on such a batsman friendly wicket, but
      at least gave Twyford something to bowl at.
      <p>
      After a top-notch tea, Twyford took to
      the field. Twyford's openers were less than perfect in their bowling, but nevertheless Bledlow were
      soon 2 down with just 17 on the scoreboard. But when Easton joined H Hale at the crease the runs
      began to flow, reaching almost 5 per over by the 16th. Then a change in bowling brought N Downes,
      and with that wickets! The visitors were soon on the back foot, struggling on 97-9. Surely it was
      all over - 12 overs still remained of the game. But try as they might, Twyford could not dislodge
      the stubborn tail-enders. They held on for the draw, taking their total to a creditable 132 by end
      of play.
      <p>
      So, Twyford felt robbed. But fair play the the tenacity of the opposition.
      And, on what had to be the best cricketing day of the year so far, it was the game that mattered
      most.
