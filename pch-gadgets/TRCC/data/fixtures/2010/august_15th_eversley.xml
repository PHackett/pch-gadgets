    <![CDATA[
      A long journey into Hampshire for Twyford this week as they travelled to the lovely ground of
      Eversley (Complete with smashing pub opposite).
      <p>
      There had been a lot of rain in the
      preceding 24 hours, but winning the toss the home team decided to bat first. This turned out to be a
      justified decision, as the slow pitch and some rather lacklustre bowling helped them on their way.
      Anything short popped up invitingly for the batsmen, and anything over-pitched was dealt with
      confidence. Lawrence was especially devastating at bat, scoring an excellent, hard-hitting 96, ably
      supported by Brooks &amp; Martin. Only Cochrane (more of him later...) bowled with any degree of
      economy, going for just 18 of his 6 overs. The final total of 203-3 loomed large for the visitors,
      with only 10 men and on paper at least not having the strongest batting side - Things looked bleak
      for Twyford.
      <p>
      Despite these worries, Twyford's innings began well with Benjamin &amp;
      Cochrane finding the conditions as much to their liking as had Eversley. A good run rate was set,
      and when Davies joined Cochrane at bat in the 8th over, things got better yet. Cochrane especially
      was enjoying himself, having not played on a Sunday for some time now, he struck the ball to all
      corners with some well timed shots, and some that were just pure brute strength! Eighteen 4's and
      one six (whiched bounced off the bonnet of a Porsche in the pub car park!) saw him score his first
      every century for the club in a dazzling display, putting Twyford within shooting distance of
      victory. It came down to the last over - Twyford needed just 8 runs for victory. But Eversley were
      resolute - Their fielding which had been excellent throughout the afternoon did not fail them. The
      visitors ended just 3 runs short of victory - A draw being the fair and proper outcome to the game.
      
      <p>
      So what had looked like certain defeat for the visitors had turned in to a
      thrilling finish. Praise of course for Cochrane, but also for the many colts players on the Twyford
      side who acquitted themselves with style - We look forward to seeing more of them in the coming
      seasons.
      <p>
      And praise too for our hosts - A fine, friendly &amp; well-matched
      opposition.
