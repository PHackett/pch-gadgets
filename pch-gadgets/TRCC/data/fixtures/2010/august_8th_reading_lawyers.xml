    <![CDATA[
      Thirty-Six years to the day since Richard M Nixon resigned as president of the united states,
      travelling side Reading Lawyers made the journey to the Stanlake Meadow ground - But which side
      would be wanting to erase the tapes of <em>this</em> encounter? 
      <p>
      <em>(Please note:
      Your illustrious chairman had got bored of every match report starting out with the weather.
      &quot;Use something from history or literature, you blithering idiot Hackett&quot; or words to that
      effect - A heartfelt sentiment for which I have some sympathy. But this was all I could find, and I
      think the link is just a little strained. But to return to the matter at hand ...)</em>
      <p>
  
         A hot, humid day with a lot of cloud cover, Twyford were placed in the field. Runs came at a
      reasonable rate, but opening bowler Cooper struck 3 times within the first 11 overs to leave the
      visitors in a less that happy position. However with the first bowling change, Baker and Mullett
      settled down to some serious run scoring, ably assisted by James and Tramer as other wickets fell.
      But the tail was unable to keep up the pace, and the run rate slowed markedly. The final total of
      166-8 looked well within Twyford's reach.
      <p>
      After tea, tight bowling from the RL's
      openers kept the runs to a premium. By the time 20 overs was called, the home side had a mere 46
      runs for the loss of 3 wickets, and things looked dicey. Then, promoted up the batting order because
      of work commitments later that evening, T Copper came to the fore. Usually a reluctant number 10, he
      attacked the ball sending shot after shot to the boundary, and on two occasions clearing that
      boundary by some margin. Finally bowled by Seymour, he achieved his first 50 for the club - In fact
      the first in his entire playing career! But no other Twyford player was able to pick up the mantle
      and keep the run rate up to achieve victory. The end result - a draw - suitably reflected the
      performance of the two teams.
      <p>
      So, a fair result against fine and friendly opposition
      - The perfect day?
