      This match report written by the good people of Big Hammer
      <p>
      THOSE long, cold winter
      days became a distant memory as the long awaited start to the Big Hammer CC season was greeted with
      some glorious April sunshine. Unfortunately for the Hammer a opening day win just eluded them in
      what was a tightly fought encounter with Twyford & Ruscombe. 
      <p>
      New captain Jon Hopper
      lost the toss which prompted the visitors to bowl first on what was very green wicket. Proceedings
      got off to the inevitable 'first game of the season' slow start as both teams blew away those winter
      cobwebs. Openers Dan Hopper and Simon Morris got things off to a slow and steady start, but both
      then succumbed to outfield catches for scores of 5 and 10 respectively. Debutant Donny Victor was
      joined at the crease by John Hinks, but one ball later was back on the sidelines having been
      dismissed LBW for 0. Jonny Shan was next in and he and Victor developed a good partnership which saw
      the run rate increase vastly and put Big Hammer in a much stronger position. Victor went on to pass
      50, but shortly after Shan was given out LBW for a useful 25. Captain Hopper was next in, and with
      Victor, they continued the attack on the Twyford bowlers. However, the visitors then made the key
      breakthrough as Victor was bowled for an excellent innings of 64. Hopper continued to build his
      total though and he was ably assisted by Jack Webster who hit a quickfire 13. Hopper eventually went
      in the final over for personal best of 46 as the Hammer went on to make a decent score of 183 for 9.
      
      <p>
      The Twyford reply got off to a bad start as Hammer opening bowlers Webster and
      Craig Wilson both struck early to reduce the visitors to 8 for 2. Wilson's dismissal of Lunnon was
      particularly impressive as the opener saw his off stump removed with an unplayable delivery. Leigh
      and Barrable then steady the ship for the away side as they looked to preserve wickets. Runs were
      coming at very slow rate and when Hopper picked up the wickets of Barrable and new batsmen Fuller in
      quick sucession, things seemed to going well for the home side. Things got even better when the
      patience Leigh was dismissed by Watts thanks to a good catch by Hopper for 41. But new batsmen
      Cochrane had other ideas as he started to hit back for the away side. Wilson then struck again
      though when he bowled Baker for 9 as the Hammer looked to fight back. Cochrane's powerful hitting
      was proving a problem though and ably assisted by Twyford skipper Adam Smith (26 not out), he saw
      the visitors home with a score of 53 not out and with 11 balls to spare.
