  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      The summer is getting old - We have had some rain, and the outfield has grass on it for the first
      time in many months. TRCC welcomed Falkland 3rds to Stanlake Meadow.
      <p>
      The home side
      were put in the field, and from the off the bowling attack looked good. Because of all that grass
      that had grown, boundaries were to be few and far between, but the visitors were still able to
      maintain a healthy run rate. Soon Falkland were looking shaky, as Hackett took two wickets early
      on. But batsman D Horn was looking like a rock, giving no chances (until his dismissal), elegantly
      steering any loose balls away for runs. He did not get much support until V-Jay joined him at the
      crease, and together they pushed Falklands' score on to 153 when the final wicket fell. Pick of the
      Twyford bowlers had to be young J Downes, with figures of 8-1-16-4.
      <p>
      So - Just 154
      for victory on what had been a true wicket - Twyford's hopes were high!
      <p>
      But, being
      British, we all know what hopes are for, don't we? Yes, that's right - Hopes are for dashing. 
     
      <p>
      At least it did not take long. A slow start by the Twyford batsmen was interrupted in the
      7th over when 2 wickets fell to Denish. N Downes showed some pluck with the bat, but his score of 18
      (far and away the highest for the home team) was not something to write home about. As for the rest
      - Well - the last 6 wickets fell for <em>no runs whatsoever!</em> Not Twyford's finest hour, and
      it's difficult to say what went wrong. Sure, the batting was very poor, but it seemed that every
      edge went in to the air, and to a fielder who never fluffed it. The bowling was tight, but not so
      tight as to explain the final scoreline. 
      <p>
      So, we'll put this one down to fate, the
      planets, the gods, or whatever. It only remains to thank our visitors for the (partially) enjoyable
      game, and to vow revenge next year!
