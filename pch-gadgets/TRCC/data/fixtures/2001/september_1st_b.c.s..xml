    <![CDATA[
       Three things made this game against BCS memorable and unfortunately two of them were bad. On the
      bad side Twyford only managed to get 7 players to the game. It marked the end of the career of Barry
      Potier, a stalwart of the club and a fine bowler who will be missed next year. On the plus side
      England beat Germany which I hope made everyone a lot happier. 
      <p>
       With the whole
      world on the Noel Downes stag weekend the Cross was a lonely place when Twyford met on Saturday.
      When it was apparent that only 7 would play out of the 9 that gave their consent we made our way to
      Sonning Lane and put the circumstances to the opposition captain. It was decided that Twyford would
      bat first and attempt to score the points needed to stave off relegation until at least next year. 

           <p>
       Yet another new opening pair was formed in the shape of Helmore and Hobson. While
      Helmore played the 'Hugh Connor' role and stuck to his task, Hobson set about the BCS bowlers to
      regain some of the pride they used to have in this fixture. The short bowling of Goodenough proved
      not to be and was gleefully thrashed to the boundary. At the other end Brian 'Normski' Norman bowled
      a tidy and tempting spell which would have ended the game much earlier if the wicket keeper could
      have caught Hobson when the chance came. Hobson (40) and Helmore (13) put on 39 before Helmore was
      bowled by Barnes. Seymour then strode to the wicket and like Helmore settled in for a long stay. The
      singles dried up but Seymour was defiant and even hooked Starling for 4. 
      <p>
       The next
      wicket to fall was that of Hobson when he was curiously LBW/Caught behind off the bowling of
      Starling after a partnership of 33 with Seymour (8). This signalled the end of the threat to BCS as
      Theron was adjudged LBW and Potier was bowled all in the same over. This left Evans (5) and Beamish
      (1*) to do their best but Twyford were all out on 78 from the 16th over. 
      <p>
       The
      second innings was much shorter and saw the familiar sight of Potier bounding in to the crease to
      deliver the ball. While having lost much of his pace he has proved to be the most economical of the
      Twyford bowlers and as each season passes tends to get more frustrated when the fielding lets him
      down. Injury brought his spell to an end and he retired to square leg to graze the outfield. Hobson
      came on bowling his medium pace inswing and managed a breakthrough by bowling Martin. Shortly after
      Theron also got through the defence of the other opener to earn Twyford another point but the game
      had long gone and BCS passed the target with only 2 wickets gone. 
      <p>
       This leaves the
      clubs future in the hands of Swindon NALGO and Stratfield Turgis with a win for Stratfield which
      would relegate Twyford to divison 2. Will there be any chance next year? Who knows...........
