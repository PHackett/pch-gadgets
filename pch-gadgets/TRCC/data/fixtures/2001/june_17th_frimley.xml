    <![CDATA[
       A new fixture for Twyford was played at Frimley's spare ground in the middle of Camberley. A well
      maintained council ground surrounded by mature trees in a pleasant leafy suburb. Frimley were put
      into bat by Twyford and made a good start. A small boundary and an excellent outfield helped keep
      their score ticking along. Twyford were unlucky as, on a wicket made very damp by torrential rain
      the day before, they had to endure many miss-timed strokes, looping through the field and missing
      waiting hands. However generally good fielding and an attacking spell by spinning skipper Nic
      Downes, at the close of the innings kept the score to a manageable 185 for 7 off of 47 overs.
      <P></P> Nic Downes kept a steady hand on the wheel as he played anchor in parternships with Woodman
      and then Wren. With the score at 83 for 2 and 10 minutes before the start of the 20 overs Twyford
      were well placed. The dismissal of the skipper at this point proved costly as wickets started to
      fall regularly. Although never quite out of the game things slipped a little further away with every
      wicket until the side were dismissed with some 3 overs still to go. A theme this season is Twyford's
      inability to establish middle order partnerships and only when this is turned around are the side
      likley to start winning on a regular basis. The big plus of the day was a good new fixture
      established with both sides looking forward to meeting again next year.
