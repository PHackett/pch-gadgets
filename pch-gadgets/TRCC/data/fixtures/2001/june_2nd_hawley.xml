    <![CDATA[
       Some fine individual performances earned Twyford a winning draw, and some well deserved points to
      kick-start their season. After losing the toss and being out into bat by the Hawley side, who beat
      Holyport last week, Connor (31) and Helmore (5) put on 25 for the first wicket. After Helmore was
      caught pushing the ball into the covers, Hobson arrived and was quickly sent back having nicked the
      ball to the wicket keeper off the surprising pace of Khaki. This brought Jez Henry (65) to the
      wicket who punished the poor bowling with some superb shots and put on 62 with Connor and 71 with
      Jackson (47). Jackson's innings in particular punished a number of dropped catches with some brutal
      shots, including two sixes. 
      <p>
       With 5 overs left and with the score on 167 it looked
      as though Twyford would be able to post a score around the 200 mark and put some serious pressure on
      the Hawley side. Much like the England side though things didn't go to plan. Three quick wickets for
      Sinclair saw Jackson, Theron (0) and Fort (0)sent back to the pavilion while the opener Khaki
      returned to remove Henry and a suicidal run saw Greg Neall a few yards short. Only 19 runs were
      scored and 5 wickets were lost in those crucial final overs which left the Twyford side wondering if
      186 would be enough. 
      <p>
       Missing a couple of bowlers Twyford started the second
      innings looking to keep things tight and make runs hard to come by. The Bowling of Potier was very
      accurate and he rattled off 15 overs for only 29 runs. At the other end the fast, attacking bowling
      of Jackson was a revelation and he ripped through the top order with only Hargreaves (30) showing
      any resistance. With the score 53 for 4 off 22 overs, Hobson replaced Jackson in a effort to open
      the game up and gained a breakthrough in his 3rd over when he trapped Johnston leg before. 
     
      <p>
       The Hawley middle order played very well and, with time at the crease, built some useful
      partnerships with Gentle (40) and Khaki (28*). Picking up their runs at a leisurely pace they were
      always falling behind the run rate and needed 98 from the final 15. With Jackson being re-introduced
      it looked a tall order and the field became more attacking as each over passed. Jackson was able to
      pick up his fifth wicket and finished on 5-45. Hobson flighted the ball higher and higher towards
      the end and prised a couple of chances that went begging and also tempted Gentle into playing a rash
      shot which he missed and was bowled. Hawley concentrated on getting an extra batting point, which
      they acheived in the final over and settled for the draw. 
      <p>
       Twyford take heart from
      this display with some excellent fielding from all involved, most notably Greg Neall who's fielding
      at point was an example to everyone else.
