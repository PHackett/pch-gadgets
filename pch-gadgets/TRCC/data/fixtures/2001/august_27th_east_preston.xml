  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       After the disappointment of previous day (when we only managed to bowl some 7 overs before the rain
      came down and the match was abandoned), East Preston was bathed in glorious sunshine. It was Hot! 
 
          <p>
       Captain Nic Downes won the toss and elected to field (much to the groans of those
      still trying to recover from the previous night, and the lunchtime for that matter!). 
      <p>
   
         East Preston scored at a fairly constant 4 runs per over for the first 31 overs, and then went
      into overdrive scoring 117 off the last eleven overs. Twyford's fielding was mainly marked by
      dropped catches (a lot - but not all - of them very difficult, it must be said). Paul Hackett was
      unlucky to come away with no wickets in his 15 overs for 48 runs. Nic Downes took 2 for 73 off 13
      overs, and Steve Beamish came on late in the innings to take 3 wickets for 31 runs off 5 overs, with
      some fine attacking bowling. 
      <p>
       Twyford got off to a racing start with 7 off the
      first over, but then slowed considerably! The first wicket fell in the 12th over at a score of 31.
      Roger Seymour battled on to a score of 30 before being caught in the 17th over. The rest of the
      batting order performed well, with everyone apart from the last 3 getting into double figures. The
      top scorers were Nic Downes with 38 &amp; Alex Neall with 20. However, the target was high, and
      despite some friendly bowling on their part towards the end of the innings, Twyford fell 42 runs
      short.
