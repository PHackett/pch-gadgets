    <![CDATA[
       Twyford again missed most of the bad weather and, in the eyes of the Berkshire Cricket League,
      completed a game against Compton which had to be abandoned due to poor light and the speed of the
      Twyford pace bowlers. 
      <p>
       Losing the toss again Twyford were put into bat in damp
      conditions although the covered pitch played very well. Twyford soon got into their swing and the
      runs came at 4 an over mainly from the bat of Downes (22) before being caught. Hobson (63*) then
      came to the wicket and again played a solid innings quite different from the week before. Once
      Helomore (17) depart, after some fine hooked boundaries, Jackson (101) strode to the wicket and
      dominated the innings from then on. Boundaries flowed, as did the rain, and Jackson was at his most
      punishing best with fours and sixes being easy to come by. Hobson at the other end kept the score
      ticking and gave Jackson the strike at every opportunity. Rain played it's part and had the players
      running to the pavilion on more than one occasion but the showers were short and did little to spice
      up the pitch. Their partnership of 135 was the highest so far this year and Jackson contributed 101
      of them in the 18 overs they were together. When Jackson holed out shortly after his century Henry
      (23) carried on the scoring and took Twyford to 246 of 41 overs before the declaration. 
      <p>
 
           With the day getting darker by the minute Twyford opened with slow bowling to get the minimum
      20 overs in to constitue a game. This worked well and they soon removed the openers Ahmed (0) and
      Yahia (22) with two good catches. With the score on 96 for 2 from 24 overs the skipper looked to
      bring back the unnerving pace of Jackson which brought the two batsmen and the umpires together.
      With still 90 minutes of play left and two bowlers capable of getting the ball to head height on a
      bouncy pitch the decision was made to leave the field and settle for the draw, giving Twyford 16
      well earned points.
