  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Twyford started their league season with a very poor performance against a strong Swindon NALGO
      side eager to do well since joining the league this year. Twyford put out a particularly weak side
      and were reliant on winning the toss, which didn't go their way, on a soft wicket that would always
      favour the side batting second. Put into bat Twyford's frailties were exposed straight away when
      stand-in opener, Potier, was bowled in the 3rd over. Kemp (2) followed shortly after and a small
      stand between Connor (16) and Hobson (14) looked as though things were on the up until Hobson left a
      ball that came back and bowled him. From then on the innings collapsed with with only Downes (17)
      supporting Connor, until a tight single was refused which left Connor stranded. The tight bowling
      and efficient fielding was a credit to the Swindon side and their reward came when Twyford finally
      holed out on 85 leaving only thoughts about the score in the FA Cup Final. <P></P> After a 2-1
      score, in favour of the reds, Twyford resumed play determined to score some points and make the
      going difficult for the opposition. The pitch and outfield had dried further in the blazing sun and
      boundaries were easier to come by. Some tight bowling by Potier with the score on 28 led to the
      batsmen chancing a run to the arm of Hobson only to take the long walk and give Twyford a glimmer of
      hope. A glimmer was all it was though as Zaffer (40*) and Sett (29*) punished anything loose and did
      not give any chances for Twyford to get back into the game. The end came swiftly, with the winning
      run being a flat six over square leg. <P></P> Swindon NALGO look to be on the promotion trail and
      few would bet against them being one of the strongest sides in the league. Twyford look to next week
      knowing that a full strength side is a necessity, should they want to book a place in this division
      next year.
