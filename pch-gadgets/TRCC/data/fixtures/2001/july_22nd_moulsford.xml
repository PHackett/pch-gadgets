  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       On a damp wicket Twyford, having won the toss, elected to take first use of the new ball. One of
      the best bowling and fielding performances of the season was iced in chilling fashion by Steve
      Beamish who took a first ever <span class='TRCCWin'>hat-trick</span> to put the skids under the
      Moulsford tail and finish their innings off. He took 4 for 32 as the opposition were despatched for
      137 some half an hour before tea. 
      <p>
       The Twyford innings, with plenty of time in hand
      took on a sedate pace as the openers ground out a solid start. At 130-4 needing 7 to win, opener
      Woodman top edged a pull into his face, slightly dazed and with a big lump on his forehead he
      retired to the bench to watch the last 8 runs being scored. What he saw brought steam gushing from
      his ears, Twyford lost 4 wickets for 1 run. Enraged, Woodman marched back to the crease with 1 run
      needed and 2 wickets left. He calmly waited for the next bad ball and was coolness personified as he
      executed a better pull shot and sent the ball racing to the boundary.
