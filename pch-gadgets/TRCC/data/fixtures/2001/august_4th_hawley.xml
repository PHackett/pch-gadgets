    <![CDATA[
       Twyford won the toss and fielded in this crunch meeting between two sides desperate to survive in
      division 1. With the pitch very green and soft and clouds in the sky the impression was that batting
      would be tough and an early breakthrough could set the tone of the game. Jackson made the early
      breakthrough by bowling Hargreaves in the first over with the score on nought but from then on
      things were much tougher with Gentle and Freakes punishing each bad ball. The bowling was poor, with
      the exception of Jackson, who was not given any support but still managed to take 3 wickets. 
     
      <p>
       The remaining bowling was dispatched to all parts and the field became very defensive in
      an attempt to reduce the run rate to less than 6 an over. A couple of missed chances proved costly
      but then the savour turned out to be the weather which called a halt to the game shortly before tea.
