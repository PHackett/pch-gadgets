    <![CDATA[
       Twyford secured only their third win of the season this Saturday against a much weakened Binfield
      side. Twyford could only boast nine men as Neall mysteriously was absent and dispite many calls an
      eleventh player could not be found. Binfield too had had their troubles recently and had thrown out
      the prolific Kendrick due to a schoolboy tantrum. They also had key players missing and were a
      completely different side to the one that was third in the league. After winning the toss the
      Binfield skipper chose to bowl, hoping that a low score would be easy to chase. This was not the
      case however as Connor (82*) looked superb right from the start. He played with more confidence than
      previously seen and hit the ball very hard at exactly the right times. After the loss of Kemp (2),
      Hobson (31) came to the wicket and added 59 with Connor before playing a lazy shot and being bowled.
      This brought Tom Hall to the wicket for his first innings in league cricket for Twyford and he soon
      found his feet with some powerfully hit shots including a six over mid-on. He added 78 for the
      fourth wicket and was bowled just short of fifty on 45. From then on two cameo innings from Jackson
      (30) and Downes (24) boosted the total to 231. Connor played right the way through for his highest
      score of the season while Jackson was at his beligerant best, even hitting a huge six over the
      pavilion. The total looked unattainable for the weak Binfield side but Twyford knew that they would
      still need to bowl well to get the much needed points to stave off relegation.

       As
      the week before the breakthrough came in the first over from Jackson as the pace seemed to be too
      much and the ball passed unchallenged onto the stumps. This brought Firth to the wicket who seemed
      to possess all the Binfield cricketing ability and proceeded to hit some excellent shots into the
      many gaps that were there. Jackson continued claiming the wickets, with help from a superb catch by
      Connor, while Downes provided the support at the other end. With Binfield on 70-4 off 17 overs the
      medium pace of Hobson was introduced, well Alex Neall wasn't available so there! He was accurate and
      this paid off when some marvellous fielding from Connor and a quick shout from Hobson resulted in
      Wright being run out. This seemed to signal the end as Jackson struck again for his fifth shortly
      after and only York could keep out the bowling. Further bowling changes resulted in Downes bowling
      the opposition captain and Jackson claiming a sixth victim and then Noel Downes was introduced. He
      bowled a tidy spell, so different from the week before, and the only ball that was dropped short was
      hooked into the waiting hands of Connor to bring Twyford the full thirty points from a game that
      looked much tougher only a few days ago.
