  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Twyford turned out another poor batting performance against Holyport this week after restricted the
      opposition to a reasonable target. After winning the toss Holyport opened the batting and the damp
      and soft conditions imposed themselves on the game. The ball was difficult to get away and the lush
      grass made every run valueble. <P></P> Dave Downes and Barry Potier opened the bowling and the break
      through with the score on 5 brought Messina (94) to the wicket. This turned out to be the match
      winning innings as he feasted on some cafeteria bowling and struck the ball very sweetly when short
      of a length. With a change in bowling came a change in fortune also Hobson (3-47) replaced Dave
      Downes (1-18) and Noel Downes (4-45) replaced Potier. Wickets fell to both the spinners with good
      catches from Dave Downes, Potier and Hobson while Messina continued to score heavily from the other
      end. When eventually he fell to a Noel Downes shooter he had guided Holyport to a respectable 147
      from the 45 overs, which at the time gave Twyford some hope. <P></P> The Holyport bowling proved to
      be very accurate and the fielders were excellent in building the pressure on the batsmen. While easy
      to stay in it was increasingly difficult to score runs as the outfield was soft and lush with grass.
      The pressure told and when Butt (5-7) and Hayes (4-16) came on the Twyford innings collapsed without
      response to a very poor 47 off 32.5 overs. <P></P> While Twyford can take away an excellent bowling
      and fielding performance, the team look towards captain Dave Downes to strengthen the batting over
      the coming weeks as more players become available.
