    <![CDATA[
      Twyford and Ruscombe sealed an honourable draw chasing a tough target of 226 thanks to a determined
      team batting effort.
      <p>
      Skipper Hugh Fort once again lost the toss and the home side
      decided to bat first on a surprisingly hard wicket. The bouncy track showed no effects of the recent
      bad weather and opening bowlers Hackett and Cooper both found movement and bounce. Sadly though
      neither could find the wicket and Fort quickly found himself turning to medium pacer Nigel Leach and
      off-spinner Chris Fort. Openers Codd and Puri put on 76 for the first wicket when Codd fell after
      skying the ball to Hackett at cover. Puri ground out 65 before being caught off a rank long hop from
      Chris Fort. Kumar then came to the wicket and smashed the bowling all over the field for a quickfire
      44 before sending a ball from Smith skyward to be caught be keeper Edney.
      <p>
      Twyford's
      poor bowling led to a daunting target and a slow start meant the middle order needed more than 150
      with 20 overs remaining. After opener Woodman was caught on 10, Nigel Leach patiently reached 34
      before he was caught trying to up the scoring rate. After Barrable lofted an easy catch to mid-off,
      Adam Smith and captain Fort ignited the innings with a high-tempo stand of 60 for the sixth wicket.
      Fort finished on 35, including a huge six over mid-on and Smith was caught smartly at slip on 20.
      Fort was then dismissed with just two overs left, leaving the Twyford tail to bat out for the draw,
      despite cries of “go for a switch hit” from the boundary as batsman Chris Fort was left with two
      balls to face with three wickets in hand.
