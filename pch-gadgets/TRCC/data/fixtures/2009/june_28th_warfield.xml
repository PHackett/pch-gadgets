    <![CDATA[
      AN inept middle order batting display saw Twyford make a meal of a reachable target at home to
      Warfield. Chasing 182 on a batting track with a lightning outfield, a slow start left Twyford's tail
      with too much to do. A draw seemed likely, but Brandon Theron was caught off the last ball of the
      game after the ball deflected off the head of the short leg fielder and into the hands of his
      teammate at midwicket to give Warfield the win.
      <p>
      A blazing afternoon meant it was not
      a day to field first, which is exactly what Twyford were forced to do after captain Hugh Fort lost
      the toss. It started well, with Theron bamboozling opener Stanford with his the second ball of the
      game. However, opener Wilson (51) and number three Doberski put on more almost 100 as the Twyford
      openers wilted in the blazing heat. Chris Fort was Twyford's star man, removing both Wilson and
      Doberki in quick succession. The off-spinner ended up with career-best figures of 7-43 after he and
      veteran leg spinner Nic Downes rattled through the tail.
      <p>
      Twyford were left ruing a
      slow start - after an hour opener Peter Woodman was 7 not out. He eventually was caught on 57, but
      regular run scorers Tom Fort and Nic Downes were dismissed for 7 and 12 respectively. Skipper Hugh
      Fort was caught at slip without scoring as the middle order collapsed. Chris Fort and Theron
      followed the captain's advice and went for the win, but went Fort was comically stumped without even
      realising he was out of his ground, the chance of the win was lost. The draw was on but Theron's
      last-ball freak dismissal gave Warfield the win.
      <p>
      Special mention of Nigel's first
      game for the club, good with bat and ball and in the field - a promising youngster!
