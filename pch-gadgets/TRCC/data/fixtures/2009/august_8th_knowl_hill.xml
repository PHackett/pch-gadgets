      <b>TAIL WAGS THE DOG TO GALVANISE AND INSPIRE THE TEAM TO PUT IN THEIR BEST BOWLING AND FIELDING
      PERFORMANCE OF THE SEASON AND HANG ON TO PROMOTION DREAM</b>
      <p>
      Twyford lost the toss
      and were put into bat on a pudding of a pitch that had been under water earlier in the week. Early
      pitch inspections led by our opening batsmen suggested they should have brought a tin of custard
      with them to make the best use of the conditions/pitch.
      <p>
      A combination of these
      conditions and some good bowling led to an early collapse of fairly epic proportions, and it was
      left to KEN and JOSH to lead the fightback in typical fashion, both did well to steady the ship
      accompanied by good support from 'ROGER THE DODGER' (clearly angry at having sat in traffic on the
      M4 for an hour) and 'BEAMERS' who has unlucky to hole out at cow corner having smeared his best shot
      of the season to date. Before the main event of the day...... yes do not adjust your reading
      glasses: Chris FORT and GREENO putting on an unbeaten 52 run last-wicket partnership to drag Twyford
      to 163-9 and a competitive target to bowl at.
      <p>
      My moment of the day was seeing Jim
      Fort's smile of pride at his son's virtuoso, battling and intelligent performance with the bat.
      We've all seen test matches on TV where the tailenders of a batting side clearly staring down the
      barrel of defeat, swing the bat and lead to a shift of momentum in the game, and this was no
      exception, I've rarely seen a Twyford team so fired up going out to field due in part to witnessing
      the GREEN/FORT batting miracle.
      <p>
      Steve Green and Raja Singh epitomised this spirit
      with a superb exhibition of disciplined, accurate and economical bowling, ably supported by
      excellent captaincy by 'Randall' Hogarth and a fielding side as keen to give away a run as a
      Scotsman is to put his hand in his pocket at the bar. It was a fine demonstration of proactive and
      flexible field placement with practically the whole team having an input at some point.
      <p>
  
         Our commitment to the task was admirable and was reflected by the fact that not a single catch
      was put down during the match, the pick of the catches was a hard choice for this panel of one, but
      goes to our talented and courageous short-leg specialist Salmoning his 6th close in catch of the
      season......OK a bit of artistic license, but whose writing this DAMMIT....lmao
      <p>
      The
      sledging was continuous and was quite simply genius at times with special mention going to
      LUNNON,DOWNSIE,JOSH,COCHRANE and RANDALL HOGARTH who I believe can stake a claim for the wicket of
      the opening batsman with the Ravi Bopara and Geoffrey Boycott comments combined with an inspired
      field change that not only produced the wicket but also the comedy moment of the day.
      <p>
    
       The home team produced a bit of resistance before Mr LEIGH (Who was undoubtedly fired up having
      been given out caught behind off his box, though as DOWNSIE pointed out this was the only bit of
      wood he managed to lay on the ball all match....lmao) put in ARGUABLY the bowling performance of the
      season producing 7 for 46 to clinch an inspired and unlikely victory.
      <p>
      Rarely have I
      seen a game this season where everybody on our team has contributed to our victory, and despite
      LEIGH's fine bowling I think special mention really has to go to Chris 'Onions' FORT and
      GREENO....... Well done lads!
