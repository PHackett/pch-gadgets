  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      A very pleasant early summer day, bright sunshine with a few clouds, saw TRCC travel to the
      delightful ground of Penn Street, up between High Wycombe and Amersham.
      <p>
      Wining the
      toss, Twyford elected to bat. It was a true wicket, but the openers did not start out confidently
      under the accurate Penn Street attack. Runs were slow in coming, despite a reasonably fast outfield,
      and the wickets were falling with some regularity. Only Woodman with a fine 61, and later in the
      innings Walkland, distinguished themselves at the crease. The final total of 153 looked to small on
      the day, but did give the visitors something to bowl at. For the home side it was Herriot who took
      the honours with a fine, long spell, taking 4-40.
      <p>
      After a 10 out of 10 tea (coffee
      cake - mmmmm!) the home side had their turn with the bat. Runs were again at a premium, with Hackett
      delivering an accurate (if unrewarded) spell, but the Penn Street batsmen knew how to find the
      boundary. After the first bowling change, Walkland took 2 quick wickets, but then opener Reavey
      decided to show everyone what he was made of! A flurry of shots sped to the boundary, and by the
      time 20 overs was called, the result was in the bag. He capped off his innings with a huge 6 into
      the woods, bringing both his 100, and victory for the home team at the same time. 
      <p>
     
      So, a deserved victory for Penn Street, but mainly a great afternoon, enjoyed by all those who
      played.
