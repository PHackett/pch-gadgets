  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      It was a grim afternoon, especially for July. Grey clouds, heavy with the threat of rain, and a
      strong persistent wind from the South-West greeted visitors Moulsford at Twyford's Stanlake Meadow
      ground. Would we get a full afternoons play in? Only time would tell...
      <p>
      The home
      team batted first, and got off to a solid, if unexceptional start, with Woodman &amp; Leach looking
      untroubled by the bowling attack. Runs mounted steadily at well over 3 per over, reaching 74 before
      the first wicket fell in the 21st over. But no other batsmen could sink their teeth into Moulsford's
      bowling, and the innings began to stall. Only Leach, who scored a superb 80 (what a find he has been
      for the club this year!) continued the attack successfully. The final score of 152 was not bad on
      such an ugly day, but really it looked a little short. The pick of the bowlers was definitely
      Herman, who took 6 wickets for just 39 runs. But special mention also to Davey who gave away just 13
      runs in 9 overs. 
      <p>
      After tea, Moulsford sprinted away in their innings, with
      inaccurate and down-right bad bowling gifting many boundaries to the batsmen. However, when captain
      H Fort changed the end from which Hackett was bowling to allow him to bowl with the wind, some sense
      of order returned to the Twyford attack. But Moulsford's openers Perry &amp; Littledale seemed not
      to care, striking the ball to all corners with impunity. It was 102 before the first wicket fell,
      and soon afterwards the teams had to retreat to the pavilion due to rain.
      <p>
      It was a
      miserable Twyford team that looked out at the rain. Cold and wet, with a couple of catches dropped
      and only certain defeat to look forward to when play resumed, tempers were frayed!
      <p>
     
      But the rain cleared, and then something extraordinary happened - Hackett &amp; Leach found their
      rhythm and started testing the batsmen. And wickets began to fall, one after another and in quick
      succession. Catches were held, fielding was sharp, and Moulsford were in trouble. What had seemed
      impossible came to pass - Twyford won the game - dismissing 9 batsmen for just 22 runs. Hackett was
      the hero of the hour with a personal best of 35-7, and Leach took the remaining 3 wickets. Certainly
      one of the most remarkable victories Twyford has ever seen.
      <p>
      But a warm thanks go out
      to Moulsford who took the defeat in generous, sporting mood - plentiful in their praise, and
      promising to humiliate us next year!
