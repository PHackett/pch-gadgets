  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      The hottest day of the year (so far!) - and it <em>was</em> hot - Twyford's merry band travelled to
      long-time adversaries Crowthorne, just on the other side of Wokingham. This was to be a 40 over
      game, with bowlers limited to a maximum of 8 overs each.
      <p>
      It was a big toss to lose,
      and lose it <strike>Hugh</strike> Twyford did, and were promptly ordered into the field. The track
      looked perfect, and as for the outfield - Well I've played on rougher snooker tables. Truely a fine
      bit of groundskeeping. A batsman paradise? Well, when the home team saw Twyford's bolwing attack
      they certainly were in 7th heaven. There was no real penetration form the openers on that true
      wicket, and some rather wayward deliveries. The change in bowling saw a mini-collapse in the mid-60s
      for Crowthorne, but they had batting in depth that day, and the runs kept piling on. The number of
      boundaries only kept the visitors out in the field for longer as they frantically searched for lost
      balls... 
      <p>
      When the overs were finally up, the home team had amassed 216 - Not
      unreachable on that ground, but still quite daunting. 
      <p>
      A couple of early wickets saw
      Twyford on the back foot, but once more it was Woodman who showed they way. His excellent 75 kept
      the innings together, and the fight on. After he was out, Downes took up the mantle with a fine
      display of strokeplay.
      <p>
      But alas, the run rate in the first 20 had been too low, and
      only one other batsman made double figures - The prize was slipping away. There was hope - even up
      to the last 5 overs - but the required run rate was too much. The innings came to an end, 21 runs
      short of victory.
      <p>
      But nevermind! Such is cricket, and on such a fine day, the taking
      part really was more important than the winning!
