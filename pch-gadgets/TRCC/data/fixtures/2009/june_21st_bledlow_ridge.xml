    <![CDATA[
      Bledlow Ridge, and the name suggests, is an exposed place, where if the weather has a mind to, a
      fierce wind can tear across the pitch. But no such dramatics this weekend - It started out a bit
      cloudy but continued to improve through the afternoon, to end in a glorious, cloud-free evening. A
      long hike for the men of Twyford, but worth it!
      <p>
      After winning the toss, TRCC captain
      H Fort elected to field first, but Twyford's bowling was, shall we say, &quot;un-even&quot;. Hackett
      was tight in his opening spell of 7 overs, giving up just 14 runs, while 58 was made in the same
      time from the other end! Bledlow's openers continued to make hay, both Bailey &amp; N Hale scoring
      fine, untroubled 50s. Twyford could find no answer to the onslaught. Nevertheless, the fielding was
      definitely up to scratch, preventing a complete deluge of runs, and the change of bowling brought
      some relief for the visitors. But then Wood came to the crease, seemingly believing he was playing a
      20-20 match, striking the ball all around the ground and reaching his 50 off very few deliveries.
      When the home side declared on 247-6, it was a weary and somewhat disheartened Twyford team that
      returned to the dressing rooms. But the pitch was playing well, and the short-cut outfield, sloping
      away gently in all directions, promised runs for those who would take them. Could Twyford avoid
      their customary batting collapse?
      <p>
      Things began well, with many a boundary flowing
      from the bat, but Benjamin was dismissed in the 5th over, caught smartly behind. However new batsman
      Baker, following the example of the experienced opener Woodman (another 50! How many is that now?),
      put on an excellent performance, recording his highest total for the club to date before being
      bowled on 45. Smith continued the fine batting form, as did both C &amp H Fort later - What looked
      like one of the weaker batting line-ups for the visitors was showing a lot more backbone than was
      anticipated! 
      <p>
      Bledlow did a fine job of mixing up the bowling, with 8 of the side
      getting a turn, but the end began to look inevitable - a Draw. And so it was, but such a beautiful
      location, such friendly and sporting opponents (and such a fine tea!), and a beautiful mid-summer's
      day - No one was disappointed. in the least.
