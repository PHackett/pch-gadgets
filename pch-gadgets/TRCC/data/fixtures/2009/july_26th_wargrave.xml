  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Playing away for the first time in over a month, Twyford made the short journey to local rivals
      Wargrave, on a really rather unpleasent day - cloudy, windy and with the threat of rain.
      <p>
 
          The home side won the toss, and put Twyford in the field. Opening batsman Lanch made his plans
      plain for all, with a heartily struck 4 off the first ball, only to be outdone 3 balls later by an
      off-stump yorker - so not a good start for the home side. And continued accurate bowling brought
      further delight for the visitors in only the 5th over, when Wargrave were reduced to 16-2. But Jeary
      and Dunster had the measure of the bowling, and both reached splendid 50s before Dunster was
      dismissed off the bowling of A Weir, playing in his first senior match for TRCC. Twyford's fielding
      was by turns excellent - a difficult skyer held by C Fort, and lamentable - an absolute dolly
      dropped by the same C Fort! But they managed to keep a lid on Wargrave. The final total of 188-9 was
      not bad in this 40 over game, but by no means unreachable.
      <p>
      Twyford's response did
      not begin well - a wicket maiden from J Clark saw Woodman returning to the pavilion with a duck. But
      N Downes and T Fort took the attack to Wargrave, and sped off at well over the run rate. But the
      partnership was broken in the 13th over when N Downes was given out to a controversial LBW decision.
      T Fort kept soldiering on, supported by Weir and H Fort, until he too was out for 62 to a misjudged
      full toss. From then on, Twyford could only muster limited resistance to Wargrave. The end came with
      3 overs left to play, the visitors still 34 runs short.
