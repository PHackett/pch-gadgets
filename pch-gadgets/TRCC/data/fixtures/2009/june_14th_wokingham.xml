  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      A rare summers day, where the temperature was just perfect, and a gentle breeze lulled those in the
      field into happy <strike>revelries</strike> reveries ...
      <p>
      Wokingham came to Twyford's
      Stanlake Meadow on this perfect afternoon, and winning the toss elected to bat. Twyford's attack was
      mixed. Hackett was accurate and challenging from his end, giving up only 12 in his seven overs,
      whereas 58 runs came from the other bowlers in the same interval. But captain H Fort mixed the
      bowling up to good effect, and the wickets kept falling regularly. When D Ashford was dismissed LBW
      after an excellent 50, there was only Pearce who made it to double figures. The final score of 115
      looked too low on a wicket that had played well - Could Twyford be looking at their first victory of
      the season?
      <p>
      Twyford's hopes quickly took a blow, as opener Benjamin was out first
      ball in the second over. Tight bowling from all the Wokingham bowlers kept runs to a minimum, and
      wickets continued to fall. But T Fort, despite an injury that forced him to use a runner, became the
      rock upon which Twyford's innings was based. When he was out for 49, with just six more runs to
      victory and 3 wickets in hand, surely the match was going to go the home side's way.
      <p>
     
      But Wokingham did not roll over! Two more batsmen fell quickly - Down to the last wicket, the match
      was in the balance. But Hackett (<em>always</em> No 11), after a shaky start, hit the ball for 4,
      scoring the winning runs for Twyford for only the second time in his 20 year association with the
      club.
      <p>
      So, Twyford made a meal of what should have been a straightforward victory,
      but Wokingham's young side made a great fight of it. Of special mention has to be N Simmons with
      excellent figures of 13-4-24-2. All in all, an excellent match that had everything.
