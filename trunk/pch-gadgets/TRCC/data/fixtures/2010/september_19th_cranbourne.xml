    <![CDATA[
      The nights draw in, and the games start earlier &amp; earlier. Close to the end of the season? How
      can that be? 
      <p>
      Cranbourne elected to bat on what proved to be a very true wicket with
      the ball coming on slowly to the bat, and despite the time of year the outfield was lightning fast
      (But the constant wind! It was uncomfortable for the fielders). Twyford's bowlers were initially
      accurate and testing, but by the 6th over they lost their form and the batsmen made hay! Runs began
      to mount at a furious rate with the first wicket not falling until 80 was on the board. The change
      of bowling did not help, and there was some lacklustre fielding from the visitors as well. Only
      Smith for Twyford was able to keep the run rate in check, but the final total of 214 looked daunting
      as the teams headed in for tea. 
      <p>
      Their turn at the crease, Twyford began slowly, but
      like Cranbourne soon found the square to their taste and runs began to mount. But when 20 overs were
      called, the visitors were on 98-4, a full 116 behind - Surely too high a hill to climb?
      <p>
  
         But a surprise was in store - Twyford had a tail for the first time this season! Opener Cochrane
      passed 50, and Smith, Cooper, C Fort and Beamish all made runs. The incredible was happening - the
      visitors were in sight of victory after a prolonged chase at a high run-rate. It all came down to
      the last over - The scores level with 4 balls to go! But that last run eluded the visitors due to
      some tight fielding, and the matches ended in that most unusual result - a tie. 
      <p>
     
      Thrilling, edge-of-the-seat suff, showing that the season is far from over in terms of excitement at
      least.
