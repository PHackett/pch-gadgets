  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      <em>Still</em> no rain falls! Outfields are bare and fast, giving succour to the batsmen and putting
      fear in the hearts of bowlers. This weekend, the men of Twyford travelled to the outskirts of
      Henley, to the picturesque ground of Harpsden.
      <p>
      Another key win of the toss, and
      captain H Fort elected to bat. A quick dismissal in the second over dismayed the visitors, but that
      was to be the last batsman to return to the pavilion for some considerable time. Stalwarts of TRCC -
      P Woodman and T Fort - held sway at the crease. Tight bowling from all the Harpsden men kept runs to
      a premium, but the total kept mounting. However when those two batsmen were dismissed by the 31st
      over, there was no support offered by any of the other Twyford players. The third highest scorer
      reached just 7, and the visitors collapsed to just 146 all out. Yes, the bowling was good, with pick
      of the bunch having to be R Birkett with figures of 9-2-16-3, but on a very true square and any well
      struck shot disappearing over the boundary, Twyford's total looked poor.
      <p>
      But the
      Harpsden innings began as Twyford would have wished, with Sweet dismissed off the very first ball!
      Greenwood was soon following him (a <em>excellent</em> catch off a real skyer by young E Farrar -
      Just 11 years old), but then there was W Stevens and A Norton at the crease. The bowlers had no
      answer to these two - They scored boundary after boundary without ever seeming troubled by the less
      that accurate bowling. It seemed like a long time to the fielders, but in reality it took just 22.4
      overs for the home side to cruise to victory. 
      <p>
      So, Twyford let down both by batsmen
      and bowlers, but they were definitely up against a better team. Nevertheless, what else would you
      wish to do an a Sunday afternoon?
