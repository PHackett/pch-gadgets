    <![CDATA[
      The old adage &quot;Catches win matches!&quot; was to haunt for Twyford this weekend, as Theale
      &amp; Tilehurst came calling at the Stanlake meadow ground.
      <p>
      Twyford Captain H Fort
      won the toss, and decided to make the visitors field on a true wicket, which with the continuing
      lack of rain possessed a wickedly fast outfield. Thing did not start well for the home side, with
      Woodman dismissed on the first ball of the innings, and then a slow run rate for the first 15 overs.
      But T Fort &amp; Benjamin once again showed the youngsters how to get things done, pushing the run
      rate up to 4 per over and the score past the 100 mark with seeming ease. N Downes continued the
      progress for the home side, but the lower order failed to make much of an impact. The final score of
      177 at least gave Twyford something to bowl at, but looked 30 or so runs short. Pick of the bowlers
      for Theale &amp; Tilehurst was B Cooper, taking 5 for just 17 in his spell, but most of the others
      were very thrifty as well. 
      <p>
      Post tea, T&amp;T began their task with some confidence,
      but tight bowling from Hackett &amp; Cooper kept them pinned down for the first 20 overs. 2 wickets
      fell, and the home side felt on top. But the change of bowlers brought a change of fortune, and the
      runs began to mount, with J White leading the charge with a fine 55. The hundred was passed, and the
      visitors were in the ascendancy. A Sharp scored a very swift 50, and victory looked in the bag. But
      then Hackett &amp; Cooper returned for their second spell - 3 quick wickets and the mood changed.
      Could Twyford pull of an unlikely victory against the odds? It came down to the last few overs - The
      visitors 8 down but close to the target. But the batsmen held on, the final runs coming with 2 overs
      to spare.
      <p>
      There were many missed catches by Twyford - some difficult, others less so
      - but all praise to Theale &amp; Tilehurst. This was the last game of their tour, 5 games in the
      past week! We can only admire their stamina.
