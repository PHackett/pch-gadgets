    <![CDATA[
       In another high scoring game Twyford slipped to defeat with one ball remaining. On a hot day and a
      good looking wicket Twyford won the toss and chose to bat first. Although slipping quickly to 16 for
      2 the batsmen then made hay. First Hall got going quickly and made an excellent 66, his innings
      being brought to a close with a terrific caught & bowled by Aslam. Woodman now took over as the
      aggressor and was scoring at will toward the end of the innings as he sped to a chanceless hundred.
      A score of 223 for 3 gave skipper Downes the flexibility to declare earlier and plan some attacking
      bowling strategies. 
      <p>
      The Sonning reply was led singlehandedly by Aslam who went
      for his shots from the start. Arial blows were always just out of reach and when Downes attacked
      with his legspin he was treated brutally by Aslam conceeding 50 runs in 5 overs. With some steady
      support from Baninng at the other end who was always looking to give his partner the strike, Aslam
      took toll of all of the bowlers with no-one able to keep him in check. Sonning raced to 7 wicket
      win.
