    <![CDATA[
       What a great Sunday. Most of the Twyford side met in their local, the Duke of Wellington, for a
      hearty cooked breakfast and the soccer World Cup Final. To accommodate this the cricket started at
      3.00pm and did not finish until 8.30. 
      <p>
       Playing up at Gallowstree Common Twyford
      inserted the opposition on a lively track. Opener Fungai started to crack the ball all round the
      ground and the fielders quickly became difficult to spot on the very large, very quick, bone dry
      outfield. While Fungai raced to a hard hit hundred containing 16 fours the Twyford bowling was on
      top of the rest of the batting and gradually applied the brakes to the scoring rate. All of the
      bowlers did a really good job and by the mid point of the innings the fielders too were now back in
      evidence and much sharper. Oddfellows posted 169, probably 30-40 short of what had once looked
      likely. 
      <p>
       In reply Woodman and Hall set off at more than 5 an over and gave the
      Twyford innings a great start. The late finish and inclement weather meant that the second half of
      the innings was played out in stygian gloom and Fungai brought on to try and get a much needed
      breakthrough bowled with fire and brimstone. Woodman fell with the opening partnership 2 short of a
      hundred. The following batsmen had a very uncomfortable time but Hall playing masterfully, saw the
      side home finishing unbeaten on 98.
