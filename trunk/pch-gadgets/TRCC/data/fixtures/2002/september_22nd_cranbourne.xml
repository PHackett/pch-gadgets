  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Twyford won the toss and asked Cranbourne to bat. In a curios innings Cranbourne lost only 5
      wickets but due to tight bowling and fielding made only 170 in 46 overs. A well watered pitch meant
      that the ball did not come on to the bat and the Cranbourne total proved to be a good game score.
      All of the batsmen did well but it was Scott at the end who added some impetus at the end as he rode
      his luck after being dropped on the long on boundary. 
      <p>
      Twyford's middle order
      let the side down with Woodman and Benjamin doing well early on. Hall looked as though he might
      guide the side to victory but wickets kept falling at the other end until the tail provided some
      support and then on Hall's dismissal took things upon themsleves to have a dip at the target with
      Andrew Evans and Beamish worthy of special mention. Even the opposition enjoyed seeing the Twyford
      tail take their regular seamers for 31 in 5 overs at the death. Cranbourne however had kept their
      main weapon, Thorpe, going at the other end. Bowling slow but big turning leggies with a well
      disguised googly and quicker ball he finished with 6 for 33 and was a match winner.
