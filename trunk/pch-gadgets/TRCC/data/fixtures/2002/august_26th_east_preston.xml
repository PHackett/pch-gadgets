  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       After a slow morning watching England go quietly, yes we found a pub that was already open at 11
      o'clock, the game got off to fast start. 
      <p>
       EP won the toss and decided to bowl. Pete
      Woodman and Roger Seymour in excellent tour form found the fast bouncy artificial wicket to their
      liking, Roger playing a couple of memorable hooks and Pete displaying crisp timing through the
      offside went on to score a rapid 75. The middle order all chipped in and kept the pressure on. Drew
      Evans managed to put the ball through the front door of the pavilion and Stewart Wren was notable
      for becoming the bag packer with an out score of 10! 
      <p>
       East Preston always looked as
      though they meant to reach the target with something to spare. While Hackett and Beamish were tidy
      with their opening spells they did not look threatening. It took the introduction of spin to claim
      the first wicket with the score on 89. With Matt Morris introduced to bowl an attacking line and Nic
      Downes consistently beating the bat at the other end wickets started to fall. With the batsmen still
      playing their shots and pacing their innings things were boiling up to an exciting climax. In the
      end EP just ran out of batsmen as Downes continued to take wickets and finished with 5 for 64 in
      what had been a very high scoring game. 
      <p>
       Won by 20 runs
