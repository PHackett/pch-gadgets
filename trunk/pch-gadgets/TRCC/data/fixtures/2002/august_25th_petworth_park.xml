  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A brilliant sunny morning on the Littlehampton seafront, ice creams, the papers a little pitch and
      put for some and the side set off with great expectation to Petworth Park, the home of Lord Egremont
      and set on National Trust land. The party rendezvous with new joiners of the tour at the local
      hostelry in the middle of town and took a tasty appetiser of juicy sandwiches washed down with ale.
      
      <p>
       At the ground an inexperienced Petworth side and a good wicket saw Twyford
      inserted and race away to a big score. First Tom Fort with 49 and then on his dismissal, Pete
      Woodman with 96 struck many meaty blows as they gorged themselves on gourmet bowling. Woodman found
      it difficult to get out and the rest of the team were left drooling on the side line. The feast was
      declared over at 210 for 5. 
      <p>
       Unfortunately the paltry resistance of Petworth was
      accompanied by white wine pouring from the clouds. The vinification of the scene was total, a
      drenching, only matched by the vilification of the captain whose delayed acquiescence to the rain
      and the inevitable abandonment meant that the bar did not open quite as early as it might have done.
      It was time to drown the sorrows with more ale. 
      <p>
       Needless to say the evening
      seafood restaurant was a bit of a damp squib! 
      <p>
       A day that had begun so brightly
      however did sparkle later as the corks popped out and amid much ribaldry dibley there were heard
      some joyous shouts of Yee Haaagh!!
