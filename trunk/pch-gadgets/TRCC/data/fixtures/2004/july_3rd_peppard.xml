    <![CDATA[
       On a fair but gusty day Twyford batted first. The opening pair of Seymour and Benjamin looked
      fairly comfortable against Peppards limited bowling attack until Benjamin flicked to backward square
      leg and was easily caught. Nic Downes then came to the wicket. After a brief stand Seymour also fell
      leaving Twyford on 65- 2 which soon became 80-4. At this stage Edney joined Downes at the crease and
      the two of them started to accumulate the runs. Downes soon got to his 50 but fell shortly
      afterwards trying to increase the run rate. Meanwhile Edney stayed put and guided the side to 193
      which looked like a reasonable score on a good pitch. Peedell was the pick of the Peppard bowlers
      staying on for 20 overs to end with the excellent figures of 6 for 51.

       In reply
      the Peppard batsmen also made the most of the good track and despite some very good bowling from
      Walkland, who was unlucky not to take a wicket, they never looked in any trouble. They lost their
      1st wicket (Townsin) on 151 but Bryan and Roberts saw them home comfortably with 2 overs two spare.
      Bryan finished with a very good undefeated 88.
