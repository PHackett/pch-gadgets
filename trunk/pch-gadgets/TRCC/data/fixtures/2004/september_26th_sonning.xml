  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       For the closing game of the season, Twyford played host to local rivals Sonning on what was a
      gloriously sunny autumn day - So different from what some have erroneously referred to as
      &quot;summer&quot;. 
      <p>
       Placed in the field, the Twyford opening bowlers tested the
      batsmen with good line and length. However, this did not distract Sonning's Aslam who responded with
      powerful, attacking shots, playing across the line with great confidence and a good eye. But at the
      other end of the crease things were going Twyford's way. Beamish, much improved over the season,
      gave the batsmen no room for error, and was rewarded by 4 wickets in quick succession. When Aslam
      was trapped LBW by Hackett in the 15<sup>th</sup> over, the visitors were in trouble at 49-5. From
      then on Sonning were tied down with runs coming very slowly - Another 15 overs saw only 25 runs
      added but with 2 more wickets falling. The tail was finally finished off in the 36<sup>th</sup> over
      with only 90 scored. 
      <p>
       But Twyford's batsmen were also to find the going hard, with
      Sonning's openers bowling almost no loose balls. Grout's 3<sup>rd</sup> over saw two batsmen
      returning to the pavilion in successive deliveries, and the batting side began to wonder if 90 was
      going to beyond them! But steady if unexciting batting steadied the ship. It took many overs, but
      with useful knocks from Hall and Dunsford, and with Woodman carrying his bat through the innings,
      victory was Twyford's. 
      <p>
       Another season over - Where did the time go to? Twyford
      were overjoyed to record a rare victory, but for both teams the weather made you glad to be out
      playing cricket!
