  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The rain that had threatened all morning held off, and although overcast, the game was on as
      Twyford, on the road for the 4<sup>th</sup> week running, travelled to Sandhurst. 
      <p>
      
      Winning the toss, Twyford elected to bat. Runs came slowly on a ground quite lush after the recent
      heavy rain, but progress from the two openers was steady. It took until the 18<sup>th</sup> over for
      Sandhurst to break through with the dismissal of Benson by Chesterman. T Fort did not last long at
      the crease, but with Hall joining Woodman Twyford pressed forward, and not until almost the end of
      the innings was another wicket to fall. In humid conditions, Woodman scored an exhausting 73, and
      Hall (an admittedly undignified) 45. The final score of 166 looked low, but certainly defendable.
      The pick of the bowlers was Chesterman, taking all 4 of the wickets to fall for only 34 runs. 
     
      <p>
       Sandhurst began in attacking form, punishing any short ball. But they were not in total
      control with many balls beating the bat. However, as time went on Twyford were unable to apply
      sufficient pressure, and the openers Speakman and Bradshaw grew in confidence. Both passed 50 at
      about the same time, then Bradshaw accelerated to end at a fine 90 not out. Twyford, let down by
      poor catching and bowling that was not as testing as it could be, could only shake their heads as
      they slumped to a 10 wicket defeat. 
      <p>
       Still, we must thank our gracious hosts, ever
      sporting in their victory!
