  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       On probably the hottest day of the year so far, and certainly the most humid, Twyford travelled to
      the charming ground at Eversley, Hampshire. 
      <p>
       Twyford were delighted when, upon
      losing the toss they were put into bat. The weather promised an exhausting time in the field, and
      the tinder dry outfield many runs. But Eversley knew what they were doing, and by only the
      7<sup>th</sup> over, both Twyford's openers were back in the pavilion with a mere 13 runs on the
      scoreboard. T Fort and Benson then led a recovery, pushing on the score and the run rate back
      towards respectability. Eversley fought back, and were rewarded as Angus took 3 wickets in 3 overs,
      putting Twyford on the back foot. Lower order runs came from H Fort and R Edney, but the final total
      of 176 for 8 looked woefully small on such a pitch. 
      <p>
       But Twyford's bowlers rose to
      the occasion. Opening spells from Hackett &amp; Dawson saw few loose balls - a dearth of runs but
      plenty of wickets! By the end of the 11<sup>th</sup> over Eversley were reeling at 30-4. And worse
      was to follow for the home team with the change of bowlers. After 21 overs the score stood at 78-8,
      and Twyford smelt victory! 
      <p>
       But then the Eversley tail dug in. Never near the
      required run rate, they would not go quietly, though they were helped by 3 fairly simple dropped
      catches off the bowling of Morris in 3 successive overs. For 11 overs there was no breakthrough, and
      only 7 overs of the match remained when the opener Dawson was brought back on to take the final two
      wickets (One a superb slip catch by T Fort). In the excessive heat, it felt like a well-earned
      victory to Twyford! 
      <p>
       All Twyford's bowlers did well, but special mention should be
      made of P Dawson, playing in his first match for 5 years taking 4-22, and of P Hackett who took his
      250<sup>th</sup> wicket for Twyford in this match.
