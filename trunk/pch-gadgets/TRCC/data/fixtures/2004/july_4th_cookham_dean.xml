  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A dull, grey, threatening sky greeted the visitors Twyford as they arrived at Cookham Dean. Sure
      enough, a fine drizzle began to fall, necessitating a delay of half an hour before play could begin.
      
      <p>
       Twyford were put in to bat, and it was expected that the wet conditions would help
      the bowlers. But this was not to be the case as Twyford raced away, the ball flying to the boundary
      despite the wet grass. A breakthrough for Cookham Dean came in the 6<sup>th</sup> over when Benson
      was bowled by Knowles-Leak. However, that was to be the last bit of good news for the home side for
      some considerable time. As the weather improved and the outfield dried, runs came thick and fast
      from Woodman and Wren, keeping up a run rate of 6 per over for the first 24 overs. Wren finally fell
      after a fine innings of 75, but with Downes and H Fort in their turns joining Woodman at the crease,
      the runs kept mounting. The innings came to a close with Twyford declaring as Woodman reached the
      century - his first for almost two years - a fine batting display. 
      <p>
       Cookham Dean
      faced the daunting target of 227 to win, and Twyford were feeling the game was theirs for the
      taking. But, the batsman had other ideas! Twyford's bowlers were unable to make much of an impact,
      being loose on line and length, and Cookham Dean made hay while the sun shone! Ramsbottom scored a
      fine 51, but was topped by Bridges with an aggressive 73. As the overs counted down the seemingly
      safe Twyford total began to look highly vulnerable. The drizzle returned, with the final nail-biting
      over leaving the home team needing but 3 runs to win. But Hackett finally found his line and length,
      and with two run-outs Cookham Dean ended up 2 runs shy of victory. 
      <p>
       A lucky escape
      from the weather, a taught finish, and a fair result - What more do you want from a game of Sunday
      cricket?
