  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A bright day, when the sun poked through the clouds, but chilly in the wind, Twyford welcomed
      long-time adversaries Odney to Stanlake meadow for the first game of the season on that august
      ground! 
      <p>
      Winning the toss, the home side elected to bat. Twyford got off to a good
      start despite some speedy bowling from Finlay, with Woodman and Baker taking advantage of the short
      boundary on the day. It was 51 before the first wicket fell, and T Fort came to the crease. His
      first scoring shot was a huge six in to the car park, prompting members of the crowd to dub him
      &quot;The white Viv Richards&quot;! The innings continued in Twyford's favour, with all batsmen
      contributing well to the end. Leadbetter coming in with 2 balls remaining and managing to score 4
      runs. Pick of the bowling for Odney was M Finlay who completed a punishing 16 overs without dropping
      his pace even at the end. 
      <p>
      Odney's innings did not start well, with Bay dismissed
      first ball by Hackett. Things settled down for the visitors from then on, with fine batting from
      Lovegrove and Finlay. But runs were not forthcoming - When '20 Overs' was sounded, the required run
      rate was over 8 per over. With wickets in hand, a draw looked certain. But then Leadbetter took two
      in two balls, and Walkland coming back for his second spell started ripping though the tail. It came
      down to the final over - two wickets remaining. M Finlay was caught plum (<a
      href='http://www.cricket.mailliw.com/archives/2006/02/01/plumb-or-plum-lbw/'><em>'Plum' or
      'Plumb'?</em></a>) LBW when the ball hit him square on the foot, but unfortunately it rebounded
      viciously in to his face, and he required helping from the field. But the last wicket did not fall -
      Honours were shared with a draw. 
      <p>
      So, a good performance from both teams, but
      Twyford will be ruing a couple of catches that got away!
