  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Mainly overcast, but warm and dry, Twyford hosted their third home game on the trot, with Woodcote
      providing the opposition
      <p>
      Captain H Fort won the toss (worth a lap on honour on it's
      own!) and decided to bat. The bowling initially did not cause any problems for the TRCC openers, but
      Benjamin was caught, mis-timing a slower one from Mattimore. Things were going Twyford's way with
      runs coming at well over 3 an over for the first part of the innings. But them Topham came on to
      bowl, and firmly applied the breaks, giving away only 21 runs in ten overs. The final total of 162
      was not too bad - the outfield had not been as swift as it looked - Something to bowl at, but by no
      means secure.
      <p>
      But Twyford's bowling attack did not start well - inaccurate and
      non-threatening - and Woodcote made hay racing away at 5 an over for the first ten overs. The
      bowling change brought relief for the home side, and slowly but surely wickets began to tumble. But
      then, once again, Topham stepped forward. He did not appear to like running what with all the
      boundaries he was hitting, and looked like he was going to score the runs single-handed. But, after
      3 successive boundaries he danced down the wicket to slow bowler N Downes, missed, and was stumped
      by a mile. Twyford were back with a chance! 
      <p>
      The overs ticked down - The batting
      side needed 3 an overs, then 4, then 5! And all the time the wickets were falling. The last over
      came round - Wookcote needed 7 to win, but had no wickets in hand. Then a 4 was struck, 2 runs were
      quickly taken, and on the very last ball of the match a single was stolen, giving victory to the
      visitors.
      <p>
      So, a more exciting finish than was expected, and desperate heartbreak for
      Twyford who had scented victory right up to the last. But praise too for Woodcote who went for it,
      risking all rather than settle for a draw..
      <p>
      
      <p>
      Alternately ...
     
      <p>
      TWYFORD lost their second game of the season to the last ball of the game after determined
      batting by Woodcote led to a desperate sprinted single to seal the win. The home team were left
      ruing a total of 162 in good batting conditions after skippper Hugh Fort won the toss and elected to
      bat. After opener Benjamin was caught at short fine leg for 11, Nigel Leach secured his second 50
      plus score of the weekend, following 78 not out Saturday with a fine knock of 57. He was ably
      supported by Woodman with 28 and Nic Downes, who attempted to increase the run rate in the later
      stages and ended unbeaten on 44. In reality though, Twyford needed 20 or 30 runs more and the
      Woodcote batsmen began to chip away at the total. The normally reliable bowler Hackett was wayward
      and it was his fellow opening bowler Cooper who made the first breakthrough, skittling Brouard for
      12. Henderson soon followed, caught by Leach at cover off young bowler Tom Downes for 12. However,
      the quick-scoring Roberts then came to the crease and blasted 30 before being stumped off canny
      leg-spinner Nic Downes after a couple of near misses.
      <p>
      As the end neared , it looked
      as if the bowlers were getting on top but Meakin's late hitting led to the scores being level at the
      final ball. Number 11 Henderson ran for his life and beat wicketkeeper Edney to leave skipper Fort
      holding his head in hands to secure an extraordinary win for the visitors.
