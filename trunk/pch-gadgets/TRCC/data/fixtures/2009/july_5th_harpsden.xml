    <![CDATA[
      Captain Hugh Fort of Twyford once again lost the toss and on a hot sticky day Twyford were
      surprisingly put into bat. Against good opening bowling, both batsmen looked to be getting their eye
      in, however, Woodman, poised on 99 club 50s, was dismissed off of Stevens' first ball by an
      excellent catch in the slips. Benjamin followed soon after, but not before hitting Hodgkiss straight
      down the ground for three boundaries. Leech and Nic Downes both got good starts, scoring in the 20s,
      however Downes ran himself out after hitting a ball straight back to the bowler and calling a run,
      and Leech, looking to push the score on, could only find the safe hands of the fielder at point who
      made another good catch. Hugh Fort and Smith then added a few more much-needed runs, but Fort was
      dismissed by a good stumping at the third time of asking, having already had a catch dropped and an
      easy run out opportunity missed. Smith was out caught behind the next ball, so it was left to Chris
      Fort and Theron to get as many as they could, but both were caught out. Twyford finished with 139,
      but knew it would probably be at least 50 too few.
      <p>
      The Harpsden batsmen came out all
      guns blazing, scoring 37 off of the first 3 overs, until Tom Downes dismissed Cary through a good
      catch by Leech. This seemed to slow the scoring down, but the opening bowlers could not find another
      breakthrough, so captain Hugh decided to change to an all spin attack, bringing on Chris Fort and
      Nic Downes. Fort got a wicket in his opening over, thanks to a fantastic catch by Tom Downes, who
      had to turn and sprint after an edged sweep shot to take a catch over his shoulder and out of the
      sun. Sweet and Norton however found the spin to their liking, and with Harpsden six runs from their
      target, captain Fort brought on Ledbetter to break the partnership. In his one over, Ledbetter took
      one wicket for just three runs thank to a sharp stumping from keeper Smith, but next over, declaring
      that he was 'basically resigning the match', captain Hugh brought himself on to bowl, and had his
      first ball promptly dismissed for four, thus giving Harpsden the match.
      <p>
      It had taken
      Harpsden just 17 overs and one ball to achieve a score which took Twyford 40 overs, and Twyford will
      need to improve all areas of their game if they are to beat Woodcote next Sunday.
