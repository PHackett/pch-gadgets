  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      On fine Sept afternoon Emmbrook won the toss and elected to bat. Their innings started with
      excellent running between the wickets and although none of the batsmen looked very comfortable the
      score fairly raced along. At 91-2 after 20 overs they had a solid platform and while Chris Fort took
      3 wickets in the middle of the innings a robust half century from Amit saw the visitors to 204 at
      tea. The ball raced over a dry outfield and the fielders, several of whom appeared to be lame in
      either one or both legs, were made to chase hard.
      <p>
      Twyford's response was good to
      start with and they were also placed at 91 runs from the first 20 overs but had lost 4 batsmen. With
      only Nic Downes (27) and Tom Fort (42) making useful contributions the middle order and tail
      collapsed pretty quickly, the innings left with not a leg to stand on! A total of 121 after being 84
      for 3 was a dismal end to the game. One noteworthy quirk was that all 10 Twyford dismissals were
      clean bowled, the bowling was not threatening and its only virtue was its straightness, a virtue far
      too great for Twyford's hapless wielders of the willow.
      <p>
      Despite being thoroughly
      outplayed on paper the opposition looked a good match in terms of talent but Twyford short on
      confidence were no match for Emmbrook on the day. At the end of the evening as the last Twyford
      players sloped out of the pub there were at least 4 of the opposition still left drinking, a sorry
      end indeed.
