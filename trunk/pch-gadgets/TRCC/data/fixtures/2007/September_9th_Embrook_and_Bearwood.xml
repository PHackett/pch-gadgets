  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A fine day with a lot of high cloud cover, but not too bad for September. 
      <p>
       Winning
      the toss, Twyford put Embrook in to bat. Oh dear. The openers were some of the best we have faced
      all season, blocking the testing balls and punishing the loose ones of which, alas, there were a
      fair few. Only the occasional ball got past Sabir &amp; Hamilton as they pushed confidently on past
      100. Finally, relief for the home side as Romel bowled Sabir. But he was replaced by Phipps, and the
      onslaught continued! Twyford were relieved when tea was called and they could return to the
      pavilion. The opposition's 247-5 looked pretty impressive! 
      <p>
       And things did not go
      well when it came for Twyford's batsmen to step forward. After eight overs home side were on 17-2
      and looking decidedly shakey! But Captain Downes, assisted by Walkland, held things together. Runs
      were in short supply, but at least the wickets stopped falling. Walkland remained as a rock for the
      rest of the innings, as Twyford survived to obtain a draw. 
      <p>
       Twyford were unprepared
      for the strength of Embrook's batting, but fielded gamely, and Embrook were unable to take the
      wickets they required.
