  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       With what must have been the youngest side Twyford had fielded for many a year, TRCC travelled to
      Crowthorne on the outskirts of Wokingham on what was the first proper summer Sunday of the season.
      Blisteringly hot, and humid to boot. The ground looked a picture after all the recent rain, mown to
      perfection by the groundsmen. 
      <p>
       Crowthorne won the toss, and elected to bat, a
      decision they were soon rueing. Openers Hackett &amp; Cooper proved hard to get away and wickets
      began to tumble! Four of the home side were back in the pavilion with the score on 20, five for 48,
      and so it continued after the bowling change. At 78-8, it looked all over the home side. But the
      tail, in the form of Shore and Jolanders would not go easily! A 50 stand saw Crowthorne close at 142
      all out. Not great on what looked like a good batting track, but certainly something to bowl at. 
  
         <p>
       The visitors began well with Woodman &amp; N Downes having an opening stand of 45. But
      after that, things went pretty well all Crowthornes way. Tight bowling, sharp fielding and some
      rather lacklustre batting saw wickets fall regularly. Things went from bad to worse, seeing the
      final 5 wickets fall for only 20 runs. 
      <p>
       So Twyford were left with the feeling that
      they had let the match slip needlessly through their fingers, but so friendly and sporting were the
      opposition, we could not hold it against them!
