       The pain of this match still lingers in my nether regions, over 3 months afterwards..... 
     
      <p>
       No idea who won the toss, but the oppo batted first. We proceeded to bowl like Gods (not
      as divinely, however, as the great Twyford cricket bowling God, Hackett of Hackett, he of the 40
      wickets in 2007, he who should be held in awe and majesty for aons to come, he of the black mane of
      death and the rat chewed straw hat of oblivion)..............sorry, where was I.......oh
      yes........with 2 wickets each from Beamish and Jones, plus a murderous spell from Eddy (4 for 6 off
      5) we battered Goring to 121 all out after 42.3 overs. 
      <p>
       Easy peasy, lemon squeezy
      don't you think. All afternoon to get the runs with extra overs to count and with an awesome batting
      line-up to come....Sorted. Job done. 
      <p>
       What was to follow was a tale of dashed
      hopes, shattered dreams and the most pathetically camp batting you have ever seen in your whole
      life....well up to then anyway..... 
      <p>
       After a reasonable, although slow start, the
      nerves started to jangle as runs proved hard to come by. Some rather beastly sledging tactics were
      being used by the opposition, but it wasn't the threat of physical abuse that did for us. After a
      decent second wicket stand by Seymour and Walkland, Twyford had inched to 65 for 2. Hoggy then
      helped out, stretching the score to 95 for 3. Even when he was out we only needed buttons off loads
      of overs, with plenty of &quot;batting&quot; still to come. But then we just gave up with the Goring
      bowlers Wincott and Slade (they were pretty good I have to say) slicing through the soft fluffy
      namby bunnies of the Twyford midddle order. Even seasoned batsmen well used to getting runs suddenly
      collectively turned into Larry Grayson and just offered their wickets to the opposition. It was
      enough to make grown men weep....or very grumpy at best. 
      <p>
       With disbelief, abject
      horror and incredulity (plus severe gnashing of teeth), we were bowled out 3 agonising runs short,
      having lost the last 7 wickets for 23 runs, the last 5 for 16 runs.... 
      <p>
       How
      completely cr*p could our batting get? Could it get any worse? Read on dear reader, read
      on.......... 
      <p>
       <hr> Or, from Roger Seymour ... 
      <p>
       Twyford bowled very
      well, restricting goring to 121 runs in a little over 40 overs, with Jones & Beamish taking two
      wickets apiece. Eddy followed on with an excellent spell of varied spin bowling, taking 4 wickets
      for just 6 runs. 
      <p>
       In reply, Twyford started off well, with the second wicket
      partnership between Seymour &amp; Walkland putting on 63 run, and Hogarth helping the total to 95-4.
      Despite the help of the Goring wicket keeper, who more than made up for his keeping skills with his
      cheeky banter, Twyford were unable to match the opponents total in a game that should have been
      theirs. Twyford lost their last 7 wickets for just 23 runs to lose by 3 runs.
