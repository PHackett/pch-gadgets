  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The new league season began in earnest on a very dodgy track that produced a low scoring but
      entertaining game. TRCC won the toss and to little surprised asked sonning to have first go with the
      bat. Leigh and Green opened the bowling and very quickly tied the batsmen down with accurate spells
      of bowling on a very inconsistent pitch that would frequently kick up off a length or just as often
      shoot 3 inches off the deck. 
      <p>
       After a short opening stand wickets began to tumble
      with Leigh shooting the top four out in a spell of 4 - 24. Steve Green provided great if unlucky
      support bowling 8 overs for just 21 runs. Our new spinner Spence Nicholls then took up the attack
      and produced a sparkling debut with the ball taking the remaining 6 wickets for 3 runs in 4.2 overs,
      including at least one batsmen dismissed behind his legs. Sonning were all out for 86. 
      <p>
  
          Of course then it was TRCC's go on the minefield and after a shaky start runs were steadily
      accumulated. Cochrane, having defected from the Sunday team held the innings together at the top
      with a solid 23 before holing out with the score on 61 - 4, Only 26 more needed, but TRCC never do
      it the easy way. A flurry of wickets saw a healthy 61 for 3 become a somewhat unhealthy 79 for 8
      then an almost terminal 84 for 9. Disaster was averted by the last men standing, Nicholls and
      Skipper Green, who saw us home for a fortunate win. 
      <p>
       As they say in the league, a
      win is a win, but it was an embarrassing one given the state of the pitch.
