  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Sun, Sun, Sun! We worship thee! 
      <p>
       Two pleasant Sundays in a row - What have we done
      to deserve this? - and Twyford welcomed long time local rivals Wargrave to their ground. Winning the
      toss, the visitors elected to bat. They started well with some strong strokes from Singh, but
      despite some rather wayward bowling from the openers, wickets began to tumble with some regularity!
      Four batsmen were sent packing by the end of the ninth over with only 28 on the board, and despite
      some steadying with the arrival of A Jeffery at the crease, runs were not coming. But then Twyford
      faltered. They made the mistake of dismissing M Clark allowing Robinson to the crease. Twyford had
      no answer to his batting, as boundaries flew from his bat to all parts. 69 after 20 overs, 202 after
      39! The home side did not know what had hit them. 
      <p>
       And worse was to follow for
      Twyford as the normally reliable Woodman was dismissed for his second successive duck in the first
      over, with Seymour soon following. Benjamin &amp; Fuller held back the tide for some time, but they
      were the only pair to reach double figures in a sorrowful batting display. But, bad as it was
      Wargrave were unable to remove the stubborn tail-enders. The last wicket, that of Leadbetter, fell
      on the last ball of the innings, with still one wicket remaining. 
      <p>
       Honours were not
      exactly shared, and Twyford were lucky to walk away with a draw.
