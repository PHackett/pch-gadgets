  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The Autumn bank holiday kicked off in great style with a fine, hot day - perhaps too hot for
      comfort. TRCC travelled to Worecstershire for their first match against a side cobbled together for
      their benefit by Eddie Hobson, to whom we are most grateful. In fact, with an important Saturday
      league game on the same day, Twyford were short, and were supplemented by some of the locals. 
     
      <p>
       Winning the toss, Twyford elected to bat. This looked to be a good decision, for despite
      the lushness of the grass on the outfield (provoked by all the recent rain) the ball fairly raced
      towards the boundary on a pitch that had quite a slope to it. The visitors kept up a good rate of 4
      per over throughout, with solid contributions from most batsmen, but the bowling certainly had its
      moments too, with probably Skafton being the most testing of the bowlers in his first game for 6
      years. At the close of the innings TRCC were happy with 196, but there was a suspicion that there
      were more runs there for the taking. 
      <p>
       Inkberrow did not start well, with two quick
      wickets from Hackett dismissing the openers. But that was the last of the joy for visitors for some
      time as Rose & Price set about the sometimes uneven bowling. 
      <p>
       Now, the word
      &quot;woeful&quot; is tossed around a lot these days. An talking about tossing, let us turn to the
      subject of Twyford's fielding.. <em>&quot;To drop one catch could be considered unfortunate, to drop
      two look like carelessness&quot;</em>. But to drop as many as we did - well - not even Mr. Wilde
      foresaw that. A truely horrendous display, and certainly the decisive factor. Twyford could not keep
      Inkberrow down, and with a excellent innings from Skafton of 72, the home side cruised to victory
      with 4 overs to spare. 
      <p>
       Still, a fun time was had by all. Our hosts were great, and
      they throughly enjoyed the game they rarely played - Perhaps we have helped kick-start a new team
      here? 
      <p>
       Also, unnoticed at the time, an amazing milestone was passed. Tom Fort took
      his run total to over <b>15,000</b> for the club! A superb achievement.
