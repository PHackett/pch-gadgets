  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Crown Wood (CW) were the runaway league leaders having won 9 out of 9 but TRCC were buoyed on the
      back of a hard fought win at Shinfield the previous week. Stevie G lost the toss but on a hot sunny
      day CW decided to put us into bat. Everyone was happy. 
      <p>
       Ken and George opened the
      innings with Ken immediately batting with carefree abandon, as if he were in the nets. George was
      out after a fine opening stand of 41 that really set the platform for TRCC to go after a winning
      total. Some very tight bowling didn't deter Ger and Ken who took the attack to CW with Ken rattling
      up 71 before being bowled by Riyaz. With the last few overs to go Hogarth was out for 10 before
      Steve Walkland came in and battered the ball all over with a quickfire 38 off not many. Steve and
      Adam Smith saw the Innings close on 187 - 6. 
      <p>
       CW came out and were immediately
      under the cosh from a fine spell of bowling from Mark Jones. A mix up coupled with a great throw
      from the deep saw Ken Fuller run out then a stunning catch from Luke Fuller at short extra cover
      started the rot that saw the score go from 5 - 1 to 13 for 2 then 27 for 3. A middle order fightback
      started before Gerwyn came onto bowl and with great support from Steve Walkland at the other end
      proceeded to fire out the middle order and the last resistance from CW. The bowlers all fired with
      Steve W being very unfortunate to only bag 1 for 31. Mark and Gerwyn were the main wicket takers
      each getting 4 wickets in what was a terrific fielding performance right across the team and a
      stunning win. TRCC 35 Points, CW 4 points.
