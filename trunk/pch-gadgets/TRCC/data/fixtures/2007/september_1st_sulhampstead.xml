  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Tension and excitement in the air. Much talk before the game. Had to get 30 points for possible
      promotion. Evil neighbours Sonning had to lose. Confidence high on the back of recent performances.
      Lots riding on Eddy's batting prowess. The omens were good. Batting and bowling talent in the side.
      Captain Green won the toss. Good decision, batting first was what was wanted. Then a shaky start.
      Openers Cochrane and Seymour departed quickly. Eddy hit some sublime and lusty shots for his 34,
      before going for another big one and Twyford's desired big total looked in jeopardy. Enter the
      Hogster, only to be run out once again (or did he run himself out.....). Twyford 62 for 4 and
      reeling. Calm restored by the Boycott twins Walkland and Nunn sharing a 50 partnership (where was
      the applause?). Then wobbles again as bowler Lean sliced through the middle order claiming hairy
      scalp of Smith and not so hairy one of Walkland who perished 2 short of his 50. Right at the death
      teenage boy wonder Baker finally got his bat to work, plus quick contribution from Nichols and rapid
      fire, awe inspiring blows from Skip Green and Twyford crawled home to a shaky total of 170. Not full
      batting points, but better than Twyford had dared to hope at one stage. Pity no overs left for the
      best batsman in the Cochrane household to make an appearance at number 11....... 
      <p>
      
      Twyford still confident of a victory. 
      <p>
       Lean took 6 wickets for 58 in 15 overs, the
      dashed rotter. 
      <p>
       (Now bored of Stuart Hall stylee. Ed). 
      <p>
       In reply,
      Sulhampstead off to a flyer, quickly seeing off the 2 opening bowlers and racing to 128 for 1,
      before Eddy started to weave his magic. Eddy kept his cool admirably after an LBW appeal that even
      Stevie Wonder would have given out. The game was slipping away at 154 for 3, but then an inspired
      bowling change brought Walkland back from the other end for a second spell. Somehow he managed to
      bowl straight for a change and with the ball moving off the seam (planned of course) amazingly
      wickets began to fall. Then, in a batting display collapse of Twyfordianesque proportions (we could
      only stand by and watch in humbled awe) the oppo seemed stranded in the 160's and were losing
      wickets rapidly. Suddenly, the realisation dawned that Twyford might just be able to pull it off!
      Promotion loomed large once again. Destiny was in our reach!! However, David Blunkett, umpiring at
      the other end from Stevie Wonder had different ideas and horror upon horror for reasons known only
      to him he turned down an absolute sitter, nay PLUMB, LBW from a full toss at a motionless batsman
      marooned slap bang in front of the wicket. The crowd gasped in horror......murder was almost
      committed. The ball was going to pass through the stumps without dislodging the bails, the ump was
      heard to say..... 
      <p>
       The ninth wicket fell on 168 and Twyford gleefully welcomed the
      approach to the wicket of the number 11 batsman, a mere babe in arms, a lamb to the slaughter, a wee
      yoof. But it was not to be. Sulhampstead inched painfully closer to their target before we could get
      at the aforementioned teenager. The second LBW let off candidate proceeded to hit the winning runs
      to break the hearts of the Twyford team. We woz robbed.....sticky-out bottom lips everywhere. 
     
      <p>
       Eddy finished with 4 for 44 off 15 overs and Walkland with 5 for 31 off 10. 
      <p>
  
          For the oppo V Thomas scored 76 and J Franklin 41. 
      <p>
       But, chins up Twyford,
      there's big hope for promotion next season...........if only we can get some runs...........
