  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       After the fireworks of Nathan Eddys innings at Hawley last week still clear in the memory, we were
      treated to another masterclass from the Cornishman that surpassed what had come before. A soggy
      wicket and a very overcast/drizzly day would usually mean choosing to field first but TRCC have a
      100% record when batting first so Stevie G chose to Bat. Welford park, a tough rival of recent times
      were under-strength and no Herro meant that we had a real chance to keep the promotion push going
      with a win. 
      <p>
       Rog and Ken opened up win Rog falling early in the second over with 3
      on the board. This brought in Eddy. Ably assisted by Ken Cochrane, Nathan took the welford park
      attack apart in the most clinical fashion ever witnessed at Twyford. His 50 came up in no time with
      Ken still on 14. Shots went all around the park including a massive straight 6 that hit the fence of
      Ken's Neighbour on the other side of the main road. 
      <p>
       Nath's ton came up just after
      drinks and was followed shortly by Ken's 50 and the two of them continued to pulverize the WP
      bowlers in a stand of 222 for the second wicket, a club and BCL Divisional record. Rain breaks were
      frequent during the innings and the day was always likely to be cut short so quick runs were needed.
      Ken went on 55 and Hogarth was bowled by one that kept low for 4 before Tom Fort came in for the
      final throes. The club record innings of 173 came and went in a flash and 2 straight 6's brought
      Nathan his first double-ton to rapturous applause and the declaration came 3 balls later. The
      innings closed on 292 - 3 off 38 overs. 
      <p>
       With a weakened team and a rapidly
      deteriorating pitch, a run chase was never on the cards for WP. Jonah and Stevie G opened the
      bowling and the visitors were obviously hoping the rain would save them before we got to 20 overs
      (The point at which there would be a result). After 4 overs we were off for a short rain break after
      which Nathan and Tim came on to bowl in an effort to up the rate and reach 20 overs ASAP. Tight
      bowling off a few paces saw the over's rattle by, the wickets fall and the runs dry up. 3 wickets
      for Eddy and 1 for Hogarth saw the middle order off and after another rain break Green and Jones
      came back on to try and finish the game. The weather and some resolute defence, even some French
      cricket shots had the final say though as the game fizzled out into a winning draw for TRCC. Another
      great performance all round by TRCC and the promotion push is really on. WP close on 28 - 6 off 31
      overs. TRCC 23 points, WP 1 point).
