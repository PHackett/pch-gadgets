  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Twyford welcomed Wokingham to the Stanlake Meadow ground on a cloudy but very humid afternoon.
      Winning the toss, TRCC captain Nic Downes elected to field. 
      <p>
       The Wokingham openers
      raced away! Although the outfield looked lush, a few dry days meant the boundary was by no means out
      of reach. The change of bowlers to spinners Fort and Nic Downes slowed the run rate, and finally the
      home side were rewarded with the wicket of Taznom. The left-hander had raced to 78, and Twyford were
      glad to see him return to the pavilion! But the other opener Isaacs, although chancing his arm from
      time to time, remained to add yet more runs. At the end of the innings the total of 188 looked good,
      but not unreachable. 
      <p>
       Twyford began their turn in bat in good form, both openers
      Woodman &amp; Benjamin playing fine shots, giving no chances away. But they were falling behind the
      run rate. When they tried to accelerate, the wickets began to fall. This combined with brilliantly
      accurate bowling at one end from Isaacs - giving only 13 runs in 13 overs - meant that it became
      clear that a win was not going to be on the cards for Twyford. But the overs ran out before the all
      wickets fell - The match ended in a draw.
