  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The penultimate match of the season and one of the best pitches ever seen at the New Twyford Oval
      (apparently prepared by T Fort senior, he of 15,000 runs in 150 years with an 18 run per match
      average) greeted the old foe of Cranbourne. The Twyford team ranged against them seemed more like a
      Downes and Fort invitational 11, consisting of no fewer than 6 representatives of the aforesaid
      cricketing dynasties. Thankfully for Cranbourne, there were a few players of lesser ability in the
      Twyford side to balance the family talent pool.........and the gene pool......... 
      <p>
      
      (As Hackett always mentions the prevailing meteorological conditions before each match, perhaps I
      should too......Ed). The weather started off brightly but then became slightly foreboding, before
      turning quickly into a major depression that threatened to engulf everyone in a tide of misery and
      dejection. Yes, as you guessed it the cricket followed a similar (anti) climatic course.....ho ho,
      what splendid wit! 
      <p>
       Things got off to a bad start by Twyford winning the toss and
      electing to field first on what turned out to be a perfect batting pitch. Doh!! Isn't hindsight a
      wonderful thing?! 
      <p>
       The Twyford opening bowlers got off to a decent start
      restricting the openers to around 3 to 4 an over for the first 15 overs, before Beamish made 2
      breakthroughs. However, this success brought Bat 4 to the crease who creamed his first ball for an
      elegant 4. Bat 2 was by this time starting to play his shots. Bowling changes followed bringing the
      old firm Downes (N) and Fort (T) to the attack and you could almost see the saliva start to drip
      from the batsman jaws. I am sure I heard little excited panting/whooping noises as each ball was
      bowled...........or it might have been from the bowlers, I can't be sure/.. 
      <p>
      
      Anyway, Bat 1 and 4 quickly proceeded to respective 50's, both reaching their targets in the same
      over from the Skip. No criticism whatsoever should be levelled at the bowling (seriously), the
      batsman were like sooo totally awesome. Pretty soon they had both reached their 100's and mass
      suicide was being contemplated by the Twyford side (a pity that none of the usual teenagers in the
      side were playing and had brought their guns with them). 
      <p>
       Anyway, they slogged and
      they slogged and we got 2 more wickets but eventually they put us out of our misery but not before
      severe damage had been done to bowling averages.....sob........They declared at 268 for 4 and an
      early tea was taken. Odds on a Twyford victory about 2 million to 1, odds on a Twyford batting
      collapse 1 to 2 million on. 
      <p>
       We were treated to a fine, albeit scandalously cheap
      (£15.10) Lidl tea (my Waitrose pampered guts are still a bit iffy tonight), and afterwards we spent
      a happy 2 hours watching runs accumulate a la Geoffrey Boycott, despite Cranbourne putting on Mr
      Dolly at one end and Mr Longhop at the other. Oh I know it is so easy to be critical, but the ball
      was absolutely begging for it, nay gagging to be smacked to all corners of the field and beyond... 

           <p>
       Anyway it was pretty obvious that the best we could achieve was a draw needing 10 an
      over for most of the time, but it was so nice and refreshing to see such beautiful forward defences
      for a change against Mr Dolly in particular. Amazingly the batting collapse never came although it
      started to wobble a tiny bit at the end. Twyford ended up at around 160 for 7. I think we were all
      glad to get to the pub afterwards! 
      <p>
       Pick of the Twyford bowlers, Steve Beamish. New
      boy Karl Bukin showed he could bowl by taking one wicket even if he couldn't field for toffee.
