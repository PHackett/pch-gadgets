  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      I was going to write this in the style of J.K. Rowling, in order to celebrate the release of the
      final Harry Potter book &quot;<em>The Deathly Hallows</em>&quot;. However, all I could come up with
      was &quot;Volde-Moulsford&quot; &amp; N Healey being &quot;The Chosen One&quot; for Twyford. Both
      spectacularly weak - So I gave up. 
      <p>
       So - A dry day! Who could believe it! Certainly
      not Twyford who welcomed Moulsford to the well-drained Stanlake Meadow ground on what became a quite
      beautiful afternoon. Moulsford were short of players, but a quick ring-round by TRCC Captain N
      Downes soon found three eager volunteers from Twyford, keen not to get sucked in to gardening by
      their respective spouses/parents. Moulsford opened the batting, and despite a soft wicket and some
      accurate opening bowling were able to put on runs at a respectable rate. It was not until the change
      of bowling that Twyford made any impact, sending the fast-scoring Clarke back to the Pavilion. Then
      N Healey came in to his own for Twyford, taking for the first time in his career 5 wickets in an
      innings with some lovely, deceptive bowling! Only Parkes with 33 for Moulsford was able to offer
      resistance. The final score of 133-8 off 42 overs looked a little weak! 
      <p>
       But things
      did not start well for Twyford with the usually reliable Woodman out off only the fourth ball of
      their innings. With N Downes at the crease, stability returned to the batting, but runs were slow in
      coming! Just before 20 overs was called, a second wicket fell, followed by a flurry of dismissals in
      the next 6 overs leaving Twyford in deep trouble at 54-7. Despite some truly massive sixes from N
      Downes as he tried valiantly to speed things up, the home side never recovered. Only N Downes
      carried his bat with any flair, for a total of 60. The rest - Well, the less said the better. But
      compliments are also due to the Moulsford attack that proved so difficult to get away - Parkes being
      the pick of the bowling, taking 3 wickets in his 7 overs for only 11 runs. 
      <p>
       But the
      author of this report did not care - After so much rain a glorious afternoon playing a glorious game
      was reward enough! (Well, that and bowling out Ken middle stump!).
