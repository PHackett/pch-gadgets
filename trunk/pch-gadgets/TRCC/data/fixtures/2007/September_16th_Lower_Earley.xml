  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A beautiful Indian summer's day that the forecasters tell us will be the last of the year <em>(but
      who knows?)</em> and Twyford made the short journey along the A4 to Lower Earley's ground. The pitch
      looked excellent, with the outfield mown carefully until the barest stubble remained and the track
      fast and level - Surely a batsman's paradise! 
      <p>
       Winning the toss, the home side put
      Twyford in to bat. Initially, Twyford's run rate was supported by a plethora of extras, but soon
      Lower Early were rewarded with the early wicket of the Captain N Downes. But with T Fort joining
      Woodman at the crease, runs began to flow! As they grew accustomed to the wicket, which saw the
      occasional ball lifting sharply, these two made the fielders work - Usually retrieving the ball
      after it had raced for 4. Both batsmen eventually succumbed, but there replacements too added to the
      home side's misery. Twyford were very happy with the final score of 227-3. 
      <p>
       After a
      <em>truly</em> excellent tea (Heavy on the spicy curry) Earley began their innings. But their woes
      continued, as bowler Hackett began with a wicket maiden. Beamish from the other end had early
      success too - The home side soon reeling on 31-4. But all credit to Lower Earley! Did they shut up
      shop? - No, they went for it with gusto! Nevertheless, tight bowling meant that only Aleem managed
      to break-out for the home side with a gutsy 45. In the 31<sup>st</sup> over Hackett, back for his
      second spell, hit the stumps of Hunt and it was all over. 
      <p>
       So, a fine day for
      Twyford achieving what for them was a rare victory this year. But high praise for our hosts too who
      looked after us so well and played the game with spirit!
