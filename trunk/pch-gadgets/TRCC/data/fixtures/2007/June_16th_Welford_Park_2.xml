  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Regular skipper &quot;Super Slo-Mo&quot; Steve Green was unavailable for this fixture against arch
      nemesis and league Chairman Ian &quot;Chucker&quot; Herrington so lanky Caversham Nathan Eddy took
      charge for his first game as Captain in TRCC colours. 
      <p>
       Conditions looked great for
      swing bowling and the garden, but not for much else. Eddy won the toss and inserted Herrington's men
      (Ooo-er missus!). In a flash Welford were struggling the first two wickets would have looked good on
      the telly. First, Cooper had Dalavori caught by Eddy at backward point, The D Smith played what he
      thought was a perfectly good leg-glance next ball, only for Adam Smith to snaffle him down the leg
      side. 
      <p>
       The rain came and went and there was also some bizarre officialdom from
      Welford's umpire (complete with Bobby-Charlton style hair) A Topic to be revisited later in the
      season!! 
      <p>
       Jurgens gave chance after chance, before succumbing to Mark Jones and a
      one-handed Spence Nichols catch (He did well not to hit it over the Ian Woosnam lookalike!), but it
      was Herrington again who steered Welford to what looked like a lowly 116 all out. Gerwyn finished up
      with 4-15, Spence taking 3-9. 
      <p>
       After a reasonable tea (No malt loaf!) TRCC
      stuttered from the outset. After Eddy ran himself out (clearly confused by Smith's ability to move
      despite being a lard-arse), only Leigh offered resistance with a good 39. He still wasn't happy
      though as TRCC slumped to 72 all out - Three runs short of a single batting point! Predictably, it
      was Herrington who did the damage for Welford, taking 5 TRCC wickets. 
      <p>
       Finally, the
      lads were able to put their finger on it - Herro' isn't annoying because he's a bad bloke -
      Precisely the opposite - He's a thoroughly nice chap who can bat and bowl ..... And that's why we
      hate playing him!
