    <![CDATA[
       In a well-contested game on Saturday, in perfect conditions, Twyford narrowly lost out at the end
      of a game full of twists and turns. After having lost the toss and being put into bat by the young
      Yateley side Twyford looked to have got of to a solid start before Kemp offered his wicket to extra
      cover with the score on 16. Luckily Connor (60) and Hobson (45) had found their form and were able
      to score steadily against some excellent bowling particularly from Massey (2-58). After a
      partnership of 87, and with 15 overs left Hobson was caught trying to sweep. The wickets of Henry
      (16) and Jackson (5) followed on quickly and then Downes marched to the wicket. He combined some
      frantic swishes of the bat with some hefty blows, including four sixes. Downes (45*) was ably
      supported by Connor, who provided the backbone of the innings with some classy shots. The innings
      came to a close on 194 which although not a huge total on the dry and hard pitch was at least
      something to bowl at.

       Yateley's reply was ferocious in nature. Massey (65), a
      well-known local player, punished even the good balls but always looked to take the arial route.
      After a couple of costly dropped catches he finally holed out to Edney of the bowling of Potier, a
      just reward for some excellent bowling. With the score on 91 and with only 104 needed from 27 overs
      Twyford had a chance to get back into the game. Wickets fell to both Downes and Jackson and kept the
      visitors scoring slowly and feeling the pressure. The Yateley side were reolute and even the late
      wickets from Hobson (2-18) never looked like being enough and Yateley eventually hit the winning
      runs in the 43rd over.
