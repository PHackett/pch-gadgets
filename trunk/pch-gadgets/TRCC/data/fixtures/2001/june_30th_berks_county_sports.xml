    <![CDATA[
       After losing the toss yet again Twyford were asked to bat on a true pitch that didn't seem to offer
      any demons. The openers played well and were seeing off the shine when Helmore (1) was the victim of
      some poor calling. This brought Hobson to the wicket who continued his good form of recent weeks by
      playing some classy shots to all parts of the ground. The short pitched bowling from B.C.S was a
      particular favourite to Hobson (94*) who scored heavily through out the innings. With regret though
      the batsmen that occupied the other end were unable to provide any support. Only Connor (22), Dave
      Downes (18) and a cameo innings from Theron (17) made it into double figures and this was the main
      factor in the total being 20-30 runs short on 184. In particular the medium/slow bowling from Watts
      was well thought out and the knowledge of the top order batsman certainly helped ease their
      downfall. 
      <p>
       In reply B.C.S never seemed to have any acceleration at all and it
      wasn't long before they were 28 for 3. Unfortunately Watts, recognised as the major threat, was
      given a huge lifeline when dropped on nought off the bowling of Potier, the unluckiest bowler in the
      Thames Valley. 
      <p>
       At this stage Watts was looking to save the game and was playing
      for his average against good bowling from Downes (2-47), Potier (2-26) and Noel Downes (2-76). The
      middle order had their own ideas and Goodenough (26) showed it wasn't just a clever name and Barnes
      (35) attacked the bowling of Noel Downes with slow lusty blows into the meadow behind the bowlers
      arm. By the time Twyford had bought their wickets Watts had woken up and had started concentrating
      on the winning post. All to late Twyford realised the game was slipping away but could not do
      anything about it as B.C.S only needed 4 an over. The end came with more than an over to spare and
      brought B.C.S 30 points and Twyford were left wondering how they could have let the game slip.
