    <![CDATA[
       Twyford lost out in their run chase on saturday falling short of the finish with only 21 runs left.
      After winning the toss the home side were put in to bat on a hard wicket with some bounce that gave
      the bowlers a spring in their step. Unfortunately the initial chance again went begging and Kendrick
      (67) was dropped from his third ball. While proving costly in terms of the final total it also cost
      Twyford an opener as Helmore was unable to move his thumb sufficiently to bat. Kendrick made Twyford
      pay with some big hits and was the major contributor in their innings of 187. Good running was the
      key to the innings and many runs were scored when it seemed suicidal to do so. The bowling of Noel
      Downes (2-43) was worthy of mention and certainly helped the Twyford side keep the score below the
      200 mark which gave the batsmen an excellent chance to win the game. 
      <p>
       Twyford
      started their innning with good hope which were quickly re-thought when Hobson was caught behind
      from his second ball with the score only on one. This brought Jackson to the wicket who continued
      his good form to form a solid partnership with Connor. They both scored runs quickly from the
      bowling offered and moved Twyford into a position that they could win the game from. With 86 from
      16, and the game slipping away from Binfield, Boad was introduced to the bowling attack and this
      marked the chance in Twyford's fortunes. In Boad's second over Jackson (45) was caught in front,
      playing back to a quicker delivery, after putting on 85 with Connor (40). Henry then came to the
      wicket and was out caught trying to hit over the top from his fourth ball. Another small
      partnership, of 36, then formed between Downes (23) and Connor before the cumberson Goddard took a
      one handed speccy at backward point to save four runs and also send Connor back to the pavilion.
      Azza (18) took chanceswhen he came in and at was a bonus when he came off with a couple of
      boundaries before being stumped. 
      <p>
       At 129 for 5 off 29 overs the Binfield side were
      definately in charge and the Twyford side were in the back foot. Neale (0) then fell, again to Boad,
      which brought Potier (10) and Downes (14) together. They were the last hope and brought Twyford to
      162 for 7 from 38 overs which was within striking distance. Unfortunately the opening bowler
      returned and removed Potier, along with Twyford's chances. Three wickets fell in three overs for
      just four runs to leave Twyford on 166 all out and gave the Binfield side the win.
