  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Not one of Twyford's better performances. Put in on a soft pitch Twyford managed only 138 from 44
      overs. Roger Seymour with one his more valuable contributions of the season to date, top scored with
      29. There were no ducks as everyone made a contribution and with the help of Extras,18, Twyford at
      least had something to bowl at. Frost senior from the visitors deserves a mention for some very good
      slow bowling and the evergreen Seymour for his miserley opening spell. 
      <p>
       Twyford
      made just the sort of start they needed if they were going to defend a small total. Hackett bowled
      an opening spell of 9 overs, 5 maidens and took 2 wickets for 4 runs. At the other end Abraham's
      figures 8-4-1-14. The Lawyers were 21 for 4 in 18 overs but at this point their Captain, Scott came
      to the crease at no.6. He proceed to smash Twyford all over the place and finished 94 not out ,
      scoring nearly three quarters of his sides runs. He was dropped a couple times off of very difficult
      chances but they proved decisive as he was the only batsmen who mastered the bowling all afternoon.
      Downes paid a heavy price, 5 overs for 60 and Hackett bought back to stem the flow bowled 2 further
      overs at a cost of 32 runs.
