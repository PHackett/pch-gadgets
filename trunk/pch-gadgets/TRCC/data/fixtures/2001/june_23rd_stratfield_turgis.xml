    <![CDATA[
       Twyford won their second successive game on Saturday, away at Stratfield Turgis, and continued
      their rise up Division 1 away from the relegation zone. After losing the toss the Stratfield captain
      put Twyford into bat on a hard track which previously had yielded low totals. The innings was given
      a steady but progressive start by Connor and Kemp who saw off the new ball and posted 57 before Kemp
      (10) fell leg before in the 20th over. This brought Hobson to the wicket and an immediate surge in
      the run rate as boundaries soon followed. Hobson (64) soon found the bowling, and the short leg side
      boundary, to his liking and punished any leg side bowling with an arial trip over the rope and into
      the trees beyond. Connor (65) played the anchor role well and used the advantage of being
      left-handed to disrupt the bowlers line by taking singles and also dispatching the lose deliveries.
      They pushed the fielding side to the limit and it seemed certain that Twyford were on course to set
      220+ scoreline with the batsmen that were left to come. Connor and Hobson put on 99 from just 14
      overs leaving score on 156 when Hobson was run out while trying to pressure the fielding side which
      brought Henry to the crease.

       From here the Twyford side stumbled along losing
      wickets along the way. Only Jackson was able to attack the bowling with 22, including 2 huge sixes.
      The other chipped in to bring Twyford to 195. 
      <p>
       The Stratfield reply was halted on
      the second ball when a delivery from the off-spinner Noel Downes hit the pad and lifted into the
      face of the wicket-keeper Connor, removing one of his teeth. Bravely, Connor carried on with the job
      in hand with the protection of a helmet and saw Downes take the first wicket with the score on 24.
      The early wickets fell regularly, mainly to the pace bowling of Jackson (4-33) and the off-spinner
      Noel Downes (2-27). In a performance that echoed last years success the bowling was changed round
      often and with the changes wickets also fell. At 62 for 7 Strafield provided some resistance that
      looked to save the game. Headford (32) and Spence (20*) hit the ball well and defended when needed
      to give Stratfield a glimmer of hope. With the depth of batting removed their chance also dispersed
      when Headford was caught at mid-on after a stand of 49. Jackson then bowled Triner for 3 and Theron
      gained his first league wicket, bowling Strudley middle stump, to win the game for Twyford and bring
      a well earned 30 points to swell their league average.
