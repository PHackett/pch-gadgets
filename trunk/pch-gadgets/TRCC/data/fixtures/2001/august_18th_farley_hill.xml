    <![CDATA[
       Twyford travelled to Farley Hill on Saturday and were treated to an exhibition of strokeplay by the
      beligerant Andy Jackson that hasn't been seen since........well, since the last time he did it at
      Theale, when he scored 173*. This could have been better as there were still 3 overs left in the
      innings but the plan was to bowl the minimum 20 overs in the second innings to bring about a result
      before the rain settled the game. The innings started slowly as Hall (12) and Hobson (27) opened the
      innings with instructions to last long enough for the rest of the team to arrive! The bowling was
      very tight on the most green wicket seen all "summer" and the openers Shaw and Vernon yeilded only
      30 runs from 12 overs when Hall chipped to mid-wicket and was caught. Connor (38) then came to the
      crease and again provided the support needed to build a big score. 
      <p>
       With half the
      game gone and the score only 63, Hobson was bowled trying to launch a ball into the trees and this
      brought Jackson the destroyer to the crease. 13 scoring shots later he was on fifty. The farley hill
      boys just did not know where to bowl! Pitched up went for four or six over the top and short bowling
      went over square leg in the same way. With woods all the way round and with short boundaries the
      Farley Hill boys explained the they were good at finding balls in the bracken and boasted that they
      only lost 3 balls a year. Well Jacko re-wrote that script by clearing some of the tallest trees
      which happened to be 30 yards into the woods! Some shots were as if they were fired from a cannon
      and Jim Fort was kept busy dishing out the spares while Noel became the ball boy. 
      <p>
      
      Jacko carried on launching the leather and passed 100 and surged on to 146 before becomming bored.
      With 13 sixes he beat last years effort at Theale and the 14 fours didn't give the fielders too much
      time to move either. Connor played the support role and they put on 171 in the 17 overs they were
      together, until Connor was run out going for a short single. Azza scooped his first ball for one and
      Dave Downes then declared on 248 with the rain stopping for tea. 
      <p>
       The plan after
      tea was to bowl the 20 overs at least to constitute a game and take the majority of points to secure
      their place in division 1. The weather had something else to say and by the time the second innings
      was started the pitch had become the outfield and sawdust only managed to delay the inevitable for 7
      overs, which still gave Jacko time to take the only wicket. The pitch then became impossible to bat
      on and Jim Fort removed the bails to signal the end, which the captains confirmed shortly after.
      Twyford host Stratfield Turgis next week in a must win game that sees the two probable relegation
      prospects battle it out for survival.
