  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       One of Twyford's weaker Sunday XIs of the season came up against one of Wargrave' strongest. Having
      won the toss Twyford fielded well but with the exception of Hackett all of the bowling was wayward
      and flagged badly at the end of a very hot afternoon. Considering the benign wicket, the glass like
      outfield and the relative strengths of the sides Twyford did not do too badly with Wargrave setting
      a target of 205 to win. <P></p> The Twyford innings got off to a great start. Makeshift openers
      Benjamin and Wren put on 81 in 16 overs and had Wrgrave firmly on the back foot. Wren was first out
      having scored only 27 out of the 81. Benjamin fell for superb 73, really enjoying the bounce in the
      pitch and the lightening fast outfield and really showing his junior partners how to keep the pace
      high. Once the openers had gone however the scoring dried up and the game petered out. Wargrave had
      not been able to take early wickets and Twyford could not keep the scoring rate up. One incident of
      note, probably too late in the game to affect the outcome was the reprieve for skipper Nic Downes.
      He was initially given out LBW to one that hit him in the groin. A trigger finger was followed by an
      anguished cry from umpire James Fort of &quot;no I've changed my mind thats not out&quot;. After
      much kerfuffell and a generous gesture from the Wargrave captain, Downes stayed put to see his side
      through the last 3 overs. <P></p> MoM Dave Benjamin
