    <![CDATA[
       Heavy showers overnight did not deter Twyford from playing a full game and recording their first
      victory since their promotion to the first division of the Berkshire Cricket League. It did deter
      their opponents, Farley Hill, as three of their side had assumed the game to be off and had not made
      the effort to contact their captain. 
      <p>
       The pitch itself had been partially covered
      and proved to present a very true bounce while the outfield was surprisingly quick, considering the
      conditions. After getting little return from the previous five games Twyford won the toss and
      elected to field hoping to use the conditions to their advantage. Downes and Jackson opened the
      bowling and bowled 43 of the 45 overs delivered. It was a testiment to their determination as well
      as their footwear, as for most of the innings light drizzle was affecting the run ups and foot
      marks. 
      <p>
       Farley Hill made slow progress initially due to some accurate bowling with
      the new ball until Bendall (28) started to score heavily from anything pitched up. He was well
      worked out by the captain and was caught soon after at deep point by an eagle eyed Henry who spotted
      the ball quite late. Guard (31) continued to hold the innings together until a sharp reaction catch
      from Theron, at mid-wicket, took him out of the game. From then on Downes dominated with the ball
      and took wickets regularly as Farley Hill plodded along at 3 an over. With their team weakened,
      Farley Hill tried not to take chances and got bogged down until Roper (32) made the most of his
      short stay at the wicket. Farley Hill limped to 136 for 6 from the 45 overs alloted to them, with
      Downes taking all six wickets for just 67 runs. He was ably support by Jackson, who came off of a
      shortened run to bowl 20 overs for 54 runs. 
      <p>
       Twyford were very keen to get a win
      under their belt before the rains came and rushed through tea to get back on the field quickly. The
      new opening pair of Connor (35) and Henry (41) were very positive and combined some clean hitting
      with sharp running to take Twyford to 69 before Connor produced a top edge which was well caught.
      This seemed to create some interest from the Farley Hill side who had complained about the wet
      conditions for their slow bowlers, which had been the same when Downes was charging in from 20
      yards! Their 8 players were all rejuvenated when Hobson came to wicket and carried on the good work
      with some fine shots. After coming in with the score on 69 in the 10th over he took command of the
      bowling and struck the ball all round the ground, putting on 49 with Henry (41) in 6 overs, before
      he was bowled charging the slow bowling of Guard. The scoring rate carried on with the intoduction
      of Kemp (4*) as Hobson dispatched the next four balls for four showing a liking to the full pitched
      bowling. This left Kemp to take the glory and hit the winning runs off the first ball of the 17th
      over giving Twyford 26 badly needed points.
