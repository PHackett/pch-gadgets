    <![CDATA[
       In the battle to avoid relegation from Division 1 Twyford roared to victory over fellow relegation
      prospects Stratfield Turgis. It was a must win game for Twyford ,as Stratfield had won the previous
      week with all other games being abandoned due to the rain, and when Startfield won the toss they
      surprised everyone by batting first. 
      <p>
       Jackson (4-34) immediately got off to a great
      start by bowling Headford with his third ball and it wasn't long before Richardson was also bowled
      with the score 21 off 5 overs. At this point the skipper D. Spence (16) cam to the wicket and gave
      Clarke (52) some much needed support. Clarke was hitting the ball very cleanly and powerfully and
      despatched any misdirected delivery with ease as they put on 55 for the third wicket until the
      skipper was also bowled by Jackson. Shortly after Clarke pulled a hamstring while attempting a
      suicidal run to the arm of Hobson. Although the throw missed the wicket the extra stretch from
      Clarke did the damage and a runner was called for. His batting was not as free after this incident
      and led to him being caught behind by Kemp shortly after. 
      <p>
       The middle order managed
      to add a few runs with Sandland getting 34 while at the other end Downes chipped in with two wickets
      which left Stratfield in trouble. Hobson was introduced into the attack and bowled his off spinners
      creating a few chances that went begging. He did break through in his fifth over when he had
      Sandland caught at point by Bradley and then bowled Jones three balls later. This only left S.
      Spence (28*) who managed to pick up some runs without taking any chances. The innings closed with a
      good piece of fielding from Nic Downes to run out Norford and an over from Jackson which failed to
      get the last wicket. Stratfield closed their innings on 169 from the 45 overs allowed. 
      <p>
  
          In reply Twyford opened with Connor (52*) and Nic Downes (3). Connor played well throughout his
      innings and provided the backbone of the innings which again allowed the batsmen at the other end to
      play their shots and keep the score ticking along. Hobson (41) played some classy shots to pierce
      the field and put on 90 for the second wicket. He fell to a soft dismissal when a lazy defensive
      stroke saw the ball carry on toward the stumps and dislodge a single bail. With the score on 106
      Downes came to the wicket and played a typical cameo innings of 20, including a classic 6 over mid
      off. Trying to repeat the feat he was clean bowled and Jackson strode to the wicket with all the
      Stratfield guys enquiring about the previous weeks innings of 150*. Jackson was more defensive this
      week and only managed to hit two sixes in his 23*. Connor found the gaps for the singles while
      Jackson smashed the loose deliveries to take the score past the target to 172, giving Twyford 28
      points and leaving Stratfield with only 5. This means that it all goes down to the last game to see
      who will be relegated to Division 2 next year.
