  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       After much ado - First the planned opposition of Moulsford cried off and then the first conference
      replacement did the same, Twyford were happy to welcome West Reading to their ground at Stanlake
      Meadow. 
      <p>
       Winning the toss Twyford elected to bowl, and captain Nic Downes' decision
      was soon vindicated. Despite some lacklustre, not to say poor bowling, West Reading were soon at
      47-5. This was almost entirely down to Nick Healey who took 3 excellent catches early in the
      innings, finishing with four in total. This excellent fielding, combined with some loose shots put
      Twyford well on top. Later order batsman helped drive the score to respectability, but the final
      total of 139 looked too low for what was a pretty good batting track. 
      <p>
       But Twyford
      never like to make things simple! Scoring at a very slow pace, the home side managed only 46 when
      the 4<sup>th</sup> wicket fell. But when Hill Joined Woodman at the crease, things started to settle
      down. A stand of 56, followed by another of 41 with Fuller saw Twyford comfortably home. Woodman,
      continuing his remarkable year, carried his bat through the innings for an unbeaten 51. West Reading
      used a remarkable 8 bowlers in the innings! All bowled tidily, giving few runs away. The strong
      suspicion was that should these two sides play again it will not be so easy for Twyford!
