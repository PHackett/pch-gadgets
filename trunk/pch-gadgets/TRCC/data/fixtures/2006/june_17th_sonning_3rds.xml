    <![CDATA[
       A hot day brought a spicy encounter between the two local rivals on a hard and dry stanlake pitch.
      Sonning won the toss and decided to bat first. They got off to a racing start with 27 off the first
      4 overs as the ball raced to the boundary. Beamish and Jones bowled fast and got some help from the
      pitch but struggled to put the batsmen under pressure. Baker was first to go LBW soon to be followed
      by Denyer who lost his leg stump also to Beamish. 
      <p>
       A change of bowling saw Gerwyn
      Leigh come on to replace Beamish and the game soon swung in Twyfords favour. A stunning display of
      line and variation in length saw the wickets tumble with figures of 7 for 12 off 5 overs. Leigh's
      fifth wicket celebrations were slightly spoiled when the outgoing batsmen threw his bat and toys out
      of his pram disputing his LBW decision. Boo hoo. Sonnings innings closed on 78, which never looked
      like it would be enough. 
      <p>
       Twyfords reply started at a good pace with Eddy hitting 3
      successive fours off Wilding before Hogarth got a tough LBW decision to go on 2. Smith, Eddy and
      Neall followed shortly after to leave TRCC on 30 for 4. George Nunn came in and helped restore order
      to innings ably assisted by Jas Lally who moved the scoreboard along nicely with some sweetly struck
      boundaries. More quick wickets fell before Leigh and Nunn saw Twyford home with 3 wickets to spare.
      A good win but we did make it hard for ourselves!.
