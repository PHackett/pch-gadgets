  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Binfield won the toss and put Twyford into bat. Modest bowling picked off the new and rather rusty
      players, Hancock and Orton. The innings had been given impetus however by Cochrane who middled
      everything until his eyes lit up at a short one but it kept low and went well under his big swish.
      This brought Fuller in to join Woodman and they took full toll of the bowling, a lush outfield being
      no inconvenience at all. Woodman made an excellent 50 and Fuller excelling with a maiden half
      century for the club, going on to make a hard hit 85. At one stage however the crowd gasped as
      Fuller was seen to be out sprinted by Healey as the pair chased quick runs before tea!! Twyford made
      an imposing 231. 
      <p>
       Beamish and Walkland put Twyford firmly in control with the ball
      and were soon among the wickets. Binfield were quickly looking out of the game so Downes came on and
      encouraged the batsmen to play some shots. He was well supported by the successful Healey at the
      other end. Good fielding from Twyford just made Binfield's position even more helpless and there
      were some good catches taken, none better than Woodman's at first slip to dismiss Jeffrey off a
      quicker ball from Downes, he thrust out a left hand as the ball flashed past the edge of the keepers
      gloves and the ball miraculously stuck to great whoops of delight from bowler and fielder. There was
      nothing that the hard hitting middle order and tail of Binfield's batting line up could do to wrest
      the prize from Twyford's grasp. 
      <p>
       While the aforementioned Hancock and Orton might
      have been a little rusty with their batsmanship they were to prove their worth later in the pub
      where they were the stalwarts of the TRCC quiz team. Another resounding victory and a £27 drinking
      voucher to boot. (Hancock & Orton, hmm, has a sort of old time musical hall ring about it, reminding
      one of the likes of Flanders & Swann and Flannagan & Allen - they'll be singing in the showers
      next!)
