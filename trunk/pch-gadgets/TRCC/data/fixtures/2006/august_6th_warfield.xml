       <span class="ScorecardSm">Sultry Success for Twyford</span> 
      <p>
       A hot and humid
      afternoon, which when the sun broke through was positively hot, saw Twyford host Warfield - A team
      not played for a decade or so. 
      <p>
       Winning the toss, Twyford Captain Nic Downes
      elected to field, and with Twyford's initial onslaught this decision was vindicated. On a pitch
      giving uneven, low, bounce the visitors were made to struggle. Hackett had dismissed the three
      openers by the 9<sup>th</sup> over with only 22 runs on the board - Things looked grim for Warfield!
      But H Fuller and Nazlin fought back for the visitors with well placed ground shots, which more often
      than not sped to the boundary over the parched outfield. Fort and N Downes brought a second flurry
      of wickets with the score in the region of 120, but the tail battled on valiantly to a final total
      of 181 all out. A good recovery from the early troubles for Warfield, but still an eminently
      gettable target. 
      <p>
       But the Warfield attack proved difficult to get away, with the
      run rate staying well below what was required. 66 runs were scored, with three men back in the
      pavilion when 20 overs was called - Quite a steep challenge. 
      <p>
       Step forward Ken
      Cochrane! A 100 partnership with Fort and a final score of 87 before being caught was a personal
      best for Ken, and gave Twyford a real chance once more. But it was not until the last over that the
      home side were to achieve victory with a mere 3 balls to spare, having been made to struggle all the
      way with fine fielding from Warfield. 
      <p>
       Excellent stuff - Two closely matches teams
      - We wont leave it another ten years for the re-match!
