  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       An overcast early afternoon, giving way to a sublimely sunny summers evening, as Twyford travelled
      to long time adversaries Cookham Dean. 
      <p>
       Placed in to bat, the visitors made good
      headway. The outfield was short &amp; fast, but there was severely uneven bounce from one end which
      was excellently exploited by Cookham's Brar. Openers Woodman &amp; Benjamin were tested, but managed
      to score at a comfortable 3 per over in the opening overs. Woodman fell to a steeply rising one from
      Brar, but No. 3 Cochrane helped accelerate the run rate. However no Twyford batsman was able to get
      truly comfortable under the accurate attack, and despite some good contributions, the final score
      for the innings of 173-6 was Ok, but looked a little short. 
      <p>
       But the home side were
      going to have to fight for it! Hackett &amp; Cooper bowled long opening spells but were unable to
      secure the needed wickets. However, runs were none too plentiful either! Entering the last 20 overs
      Cookham still required 5 per over for victory. But try as they might Twyford could not hold the home
      side back. They scored at almost exactly the required run rate for the remainder of the innings,
      finally snatching victory with but two balls to spare, an excellent 44 not out from I Mettler
      bringing them home safely. 
      <p>
       Another highly enjoyable game in beautiful surroundings
      with weather to match, but another defeat for Twyford!
