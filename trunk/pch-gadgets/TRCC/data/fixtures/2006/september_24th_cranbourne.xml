  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Ah.... Here we are again, and to paraphrase Mr. Gilmore &quot;<em>Shorter of breath, and one season
      closer to death....</em>&quot; 
      <p>
       But leave the gloomy philosophising for another
      time - This was a glorious day to end the season on. Bright sunshine and warm temperatures this late
      in the year are a certain bonus, and Cranbourne, under the watchful eye or her majesty the Quoon
      from Windsor Castle, making a delightful setting. Woodman won the toss (Downes <em>late...</em>) and
      inserted the oppo in to bat. The Twyford openers Beamish &amp; Hackett vindicated that decision with
      only 40 runs scored and 2 wickets taken in the first 20 overs. But with the change of bowling, the
      tide also changed. Thorpe was excellent reaching an undefeated 102 as a couple of dropped catches
      let Cranbourne off the hook. The final score of 197 was far more than had been anticipated half way
      through their innings! 
      <p>
       Twyford got off to a fast start, with Woodman leading the
      way. But apart from Peter, the only other significant contribution was to come from Downes, the
      others folding on what was a very reasonable batting track. Not to take anything away from the home
      side who fielded 7 bowlers, each of whom performed well. 
      <p>
       The death knell for
      Twford fell on the penultimate ball of the game when Thorpe dismissed H Fort with a lovely ball.
      Another season was over, but such a pleasant game, showing once more that Cricket is surely the
      pinacle of human achievement &amp; civilisation, who could be downhearted?
