  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A wet bank holiday weekend was generous enough to allow a full game of cricket, Twyford travelling
      to local rivals Sonning. 
      <p>
       Winning the toss, Sonning placed Twyford in to bat. Early
      overs saw runs added at a reasonable rate with little penetration from the bowlers. Nevertheless,
      Martin was out in the 6<sup>th</sup> over, a second wicket falling in the 17<sup>th</sup> with only
      45 on the board. But then opener Woodman and number 4 Cochrane turned on the tap! 122 runs were
      added in the next 17 overs before Cochrane was unlucky to play-on for 86. Woodman continued his
      excellent form this season to end on 62. Twyford were quite happy with the final score of 192. 
    
       <p>
       However, with the first ball from Hackett being dispatched to the boundary by Sohail for
      4, Twyford were quick to fall to earth. Sonning raced away, Sohail dispatching boundaries so quickly
      that when his teammates cheered from the pavilion for his 50, the scoreboard showed only 45! Twyford
      had no answer - 112 runs were on the board before the first wicket fell in the 19<sup>th</sup> over,
      180 when the second wicket fell. Sonning romped home to victory in only 29.5 overs. 
      <p>
     
       A hard loss for Twyford, but at least we got to play a game!
