  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The day started badly and didn't get much better. Down to ten men, with a weakened side, and having
      to forfeit the toss due to having got lost on the way to Welford, pretty much summed it up. 
     
      <p>
       Once the rain stopped we got under way with a slightly reduced overs game (42 overs). The
      wind was howling straight across the wicket, which was very green, quite hard but with a spongy top
      (sounds like a cake!). The 2 opening bowlers quickly created havoc removing Hogarth for one with a
      fine nick to the keeper, then following up next ball with Hancock getting one that came in from 6
      inches outside off to take the bails off. 
      <p>
       Wickets continued to tumble with Alex
      Burke also falling without troubling the scorers. Chris Smith, debuting for TRCC played some
      handsome shots and added some solidity with Josh baker before they both fell short of double
      figures, Baker being the unlucky party in a run-out with Jim Fort. 
      <p>
       Beamish was
      another to fall for nought to a wildly inswinging ball before Green and Cooper took advantage of
      some bowling changes to give the scoreboard a semblance of respectability. All out for 70, we missed
      out on a batting point and hold the dubious honour of having the highest and lowest batting totals
      in Div 6 this season. 
      <p>

      <p>
       A total of 70, with
      60 odd overs to get them in, was not much to defend but Beamish and Cooper immediately bowled good
      line and length to put the pressure on the opening batsmen. An early wicket saw Beamish take the
      offstump from xxx before a period of consolidation saw the scoreboard steadily tick over. 
     
      <p>
       Chris Smith came on to bowl and after a couple of looseners found a good line. Wickets in
      Consecutive balls set up a potential multiple-jug-buying hatrick but this was not to be and Welford
      batted out the remaining runs scoring a win by 7 wickets with TRCC gaining a solitary point. The
      good thing about this division is that we play each team 3 times so there is plenty of time for
      revenge!!. Next time lads, we'll murder 'em.
