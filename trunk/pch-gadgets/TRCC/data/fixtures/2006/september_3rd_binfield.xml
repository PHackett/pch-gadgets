       <span class="ScorecardSm">Extraordinary game .... that I missed!</span> 
      <p>
       Until I
      get the full report, have a look <a
      href="http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/2003/2003738/2_bowlers_6_balls_and_2_hattricks">here</a>

       2 bowlers, 6 balls and 2 hat-tricks Cricketers in Twyford are
      investigating whether their players have performed a cricketing first with two hat-tricks by two
      bowlers in the same game. 
      <p>
       The extraordinary feat happened in an away fixture
      against Binfield, during which paceman Tim Cooper and veteran spinner Tom Fort both got three
      batsmen out in three consecutive balls. 
      <p>
       Twyford and Ruscombe Cricket Club has a
      large number of players who have been playing village cricket for more than 25 years and no-one can
      recall ever seeing a double hat-trick before. 
      <p>
       Mr Cooper, who is in his first full
      season for the club, ripped through Binfield's top order batsmen, taking the wickets of both openers
      and the number four batsmen. 
      <p>
       Wicket-keeper Adam Smith described the three balls as
      "a terrible shot, a good catch and a good old-fashioned straight ball". 
      <p>
       After
      taking his third wicket, Mr Cooper was heard to say: "I don't really care what happens now. 
     
      <p>
       "I've taken a hat-trick." 
      <p>
       Mr Fort, who has scored more than 10,000 runs
      for the club and is in his 33rd season, took the tail-end of the batting order apart. 
      <p>
   
         He said: "I'm thrilled. I've taken one hat-trick before but that was when I was a quick bowler
      more than 30 years ago when I got the figures of six wickets for one run, but wickets were more
      helpful back then. 
      <p>
       "I didn't think it would happen again. When I got two in a row
      I just concentrated on bowling a straight ball and the batsmen missed it. 
      <p>
       "I've
      seen batsmen running seven in one go, one-handed catches on the boundary, dreadful umpiring
      decisions, comical run-outs and people being sick in the bushes while fielding, but I've never seen
      anything like this and doubt I will again." 
      <p>
       The club is now set to consult Wisden
      Cricket Monthly magazine to try to find out if a double hat-trick has ever been done before. 
     
      <p>
       Twyford won the match comfortably with five wickets to spare, with batsman Ken Cochrane
      smashing 75 not out, as the club comfortably reached the target of 121. 
      <p>
       The club
      is always looking for new talent. For more information visit the website www.twyfordcc.org.uk.
