  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Warfield won the toss and elected to bowl on an overcast and blustery afternoon. The bowling was
      tight as skipper Morris and the left arm Ruddle who was getting significant movement in the air tied
      the Twyford batsmen down. Seymour went early but Woodman and Nic Downes hung in there and although
      only 40 runs were scored off the first 20 overs wickets were still in hand. This was to prove
      crucial as eventually the bowling tired, changed and generally loosened up. Woodman playing the
      anchor role throughout the innings found his timing and the scoring accelerated, he finished with a
      magnificent century and was given good support at the end of the innings by Smith. Twyford finished
      on 188-4, an excellent effort given the quality of the early bowling.
      <p>
      Warfield's
      reply had good momentum early on although they did keep losing a wicket every now and then. Cooper
      bowled particularly quickly down wind and was to be replaced by the young Joe Downes who was
      probably the pick of the bowlers and ended up with 2 for 21. All 3 results were in the balance but
      the later Warfield batsmen could not quite keep up the scoring rate. As wickets fell as Warfield
      pushed on, Twyford thought they might be in with a chance but match ended in a well played draw and
      honours even.
