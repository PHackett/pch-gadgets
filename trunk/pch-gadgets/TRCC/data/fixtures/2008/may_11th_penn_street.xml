  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Just about the best cricketing weather you can possibly have! Hot &amp; sunny, yet not stifling,
      and with a pleasant gentle breeze. How lucky we are to have days like these! Penn Street travelled
      to Twyford to find a pretty green wicket & outfield, but one that played true and afforded may
      boundaries during the match. The visitors were rather short of players, so TRCC loaned them a
      couple, and we played 10 a side. 
      <p>
       TRCC opened the batting, and despite some fairly
      nippy bowling, Woodman & N Downes were very comfortable at the crease. It took a few overs, but when
      they settled in the runs began to flow. It was not until the 16<sup>th</sup> over that the first
      wicket fell - Downes caught going for a big one (<em>Never</em> seen that before!) - but the
      following batsmen ably supported Woodman past his 50, on to a final total of 73 - An excellent
      knock. The tail fell without putting up much of a fight with Ribaud back for his second spell and on
      fine form, but Twyford were reasonably happy with their final score of 174 
      <p>
       Penn
      Street made a steady if unimpressive start to their innings, with the bowling of Hackett proving
      tough to get away. But openers Reavey and Fletcher looked like they knew what they were doing and
      played a straight bat. Eventually the opening partnership was broken with the score on 60. Then it
      was time for Twyford's fielding to play a role - And not in a good way as far as the home side were
      concerned. 6 catches that should have been held were put down, and a few half chances too. A poor
      performance that provoked a tougue-lashing from the Captain N Downes. Nevertheless, wickets were
      falling! Hackett back for his second spell took 2 in 2 balls, and N Downes eventually claimed 5. It
      all came down to the last over - Penn Street had just one wicket left, and 3 balls to survive. But
      survive they did for a well earned draw. 
      <p>
       So, Twyford would have relished a win
      after their poor performance last week, but were happy to have taken part in such an excellent
      afternoon's sport with a well-matched and pleasant opposition.
