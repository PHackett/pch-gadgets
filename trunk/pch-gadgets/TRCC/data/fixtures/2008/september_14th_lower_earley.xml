    <![CDATA[
      <b><em>All hail the Sun god! Bask in his beauty and majesty!</em></b>
      <p>
      After what
      seemed like miserable grey skies forever, the afternoon was <em>glorious</em>, and TRCC were happy
      to host Lower Earley at the Stanlake Meadow ground.
      <p>
      Winning the toss, the home side
      decided to bat on what was a true, but very damp wicket from which the ball never 'came on to the
      bat'. Lower Earley's openers were straight and true - One swinging it out, the other swinging it in,
      much to the confusion of the batsmen. Runs were in very short supply with that attack, 16 runs off
      the first 16 overs for the loss of two wickets. But Cochrane decided to attack! On a wicket that was
      anything but a batsman paradise he had to hit and run hard to reach his first 50 of the season, ably
      supported by A Smith with a fighting 37. The final total of 132-5 was much more that Twyford had had
      reason to hope for half way through the innings, and with the slow wicket and very slow outfield it
      did not look too bad ...
      <p>
      But after tea Lower Earley set off at a brisk pace (well,
      brisk for the circumstances, and far faster than Twyford). Aided by some <em>very</em> poor catching
      from the home side they reached 45 before the first wicket fell. However, with the change of bowlers
      TRCC began to apply more pressure, and the catches started to stick! What was at first a very low
      required run rate began to creep up and the wickets carried on falling. Cochrane - this time with
      the ball - had success, and as the 20 overs counted down the result was too close to call - With 2
      overs remaining the opposition was on 119-9. In the end, it honours were shared as they game ended
      in a tight draw.
      <p>
      A fine game then, with a great opposition. But mainly it felt so
      good to see blue sky and the Sun once more ...
