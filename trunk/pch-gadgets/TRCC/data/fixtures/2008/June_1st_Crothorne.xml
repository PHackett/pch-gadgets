  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Depite some worrying weather reports, Sunday in Twyford, though overcast, was pleasant, warm and
      most importantly, <em>dry!</em> Twyford played host to Crowthorne at Stanlake Meadow.
      <p>
    
       Winning the toss, Twyford capatin Nic Downes elected to bat - A desision he was soon ruing! A mere
      10 balls in to the innings he was heading back to the pavilion, caught off a mis-timed shot. And
      things did not improve for the home side. Bad batting was the theme of the innings, combined with a
      devastating late spell of bowling from McDonner. The last 4 batsmen were all dismissed for 0, and
      none took away much pride. The final total of 84 looked woefully small.
      <p>
      But
      Crowthorne's progress to victory was not to be smooth! Openers Hackett &amp; Walkland were accurate
      from the off, and after 10 overs the visitors were reeling at 15-3. But the needed wickets did not
      continue to fall. Sudar - Chancing his arm a bit - pushed the score on with a quick 21 until run out
      with the score on 46. Then N Stent &amp; Short batted on resolutely, but it took until the
      32<sup>nd</sup> over for victory to be clinched.
      <p>
      So, Crowthorne deserved victors,
      but they had to work at it! And the home side needs to shake its batting up a bit.
