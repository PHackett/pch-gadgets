  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Confidence was high for the visit of Welford Park, languishing at the bottom of the league table and
      with Twyford presenting a relatively strong side (according to some allegedly in the know). There
      was some weather about, but quite frankly it was of little consequence, but if you want a detailed
      synopsis of meteorological conditions prevailing at the time, you know where to go for it (he has a
      long mane of jet black hair and an assortment of quite unique t-shirts - where does he do his
      shopping?). 
      <p>
      I have no idea who won the toss, but Twyford batted first. Despite the
      potential strength of the oppo, my thoughts immediately turned to a potentially short match and the
      prospect of getting home early to cut the grass (or to read a Tom Fort book), such was my faith in
      the Twyford batting potential. However, thankfully, these treasonous thoughts were soon banished by
      a good opening partnership from Adam Smith and Sir Nathan of Eddy, the patron saint of the Saturday
      side. A 58 opening partnership with some lusty blows from Nathan and some blowing lusts from Adam
      put the home side in a good opening position.
      <p>
      Unfortunately after Nathan perished at
      47 (not literally, thank God) and Gerwyn for 19, just as he too looked to be going for a big score,
      the wheels of the bus looked to be starting to come off. At the crease came the Boycott Brothers,
      &quot;Front-foot&quot; Fuller and &quot;One-shot&quot; Walkland. It has to be said at this point
      that the Welford Park bowlers, especially Herrington and Blair, were on the spot and moving the ball
      past the batsmen with consummate ease. Or were the batsmen just missing everything?
      <p>
     
      After quite a few overs for very few runs and a couple of suicidal quick runs (Fuller trying to
      steal the strike of course) the batsmen could sense the growing tension from the rest of the team
      that they needed to get a ***cking move on. This was partly achieved by the Boycott twins (with a 63
      partnership), although it was not a pretty sight, unless you like gratuitous wild slogging. Some
      fine blows at the end from Mark Jones and Chris Fort edged Twyford over the 175 maximum batting
      points marker and to a final score of 185 for 7. Not too bad, but it should perhaps have been more.
      Blame Fuller, I say.
      <p>
      Steve B and Steve G got stuck into the Welford Park reply and
      Steve B struck early with a smart caught and bowled. Steve B then struck and Welford were reeling at
      28 for 2. However, this brought Herrington, the Twyford nemesis, to the crease and he and Westbrook
      started to get amongst the runs. They soon had a 50 partnership and Twyford were starting to become
      despondent - heads were dropping. As too were the catches, a drop from Walkland and then one shortly
      after from Fuller, normally a safe pair of hands (unless there is a bat in them).
      <p>
     
      Just when Twyford thought the game was getting away from them, Westbook was bowled by Nathan for 61
      and shortly after Herrington holed out to Hoggie for 29. A wicket followed with the very next ball
      (a great catch from George Nunn), hat-trick then denied, but with the next ball Walkland bowled
      Jergens. The dam was breached and confidence surged back in bucket-loads to the Twyford team.
      Welford had gone from 120 for 4, to 135 for 8 and victory was now in sight. We just needed to get
      the last 2 wickets.
      <p>
      Another wicket for Sir Nathan of Eddy (3 for 41) and another for
      Walkland (5 for 38) sealed the win. Frustration had turned to jubilation in a few short overs. A
      lesson for every game. Never give up, keep believing, keep plugging away and if you are lucky (or
      the oppo only have 2 batsmen) you might just turn it around.
      <p>
      Maximum points again!
      Job done. Sorted.
