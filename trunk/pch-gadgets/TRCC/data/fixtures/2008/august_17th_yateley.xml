  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      Last-minute replacement Yateley paid a visit to Stanlake Meadow on an overcast, and towards the end
      chilly afternoon in Twyford.
      <p>
      <del>Twyford won the toss, and elected to field.
      Looking back, that was the highlight of the game for the home team.</del> The visitors won the toss,
      and elected to bat. Yateley, considerably younger (someone calculated that the combined ages of
      their four youngest players was still less that that of Twyford's oldest!), and let's face it more
      talented, they swept the none-too penetrating bowling aside with ease. Openers Dow and Wood were
      hardly bothered once, amassing fine totals with speed and style. Twyford could only wait for their
      mistakes (and pray for rain!). But their dismissals did not slow the run rate. The final total of
      241 was pretty good for that afternoon, but unassailable? Maybe not!
      <p>
      Well, yes -
      unassailable. 
      <p>
      Yateley's bowling was almost as good as their batting. Only T Fort
      put up any resistance for the home side, but the tail started early that afternoon, and the home
      side collapsed to 85 all out.
      <p>
      So, a sobering day for Twyford. But we were slightly
      buoyed when we discovered that Yateley had at least 4 county-level colts in their side, and this
      salvaged a little of the bruised egos.
      <p>
      Me, I'm off for some fishcakes (Yum Yum!).
