    <![CDATA[
      In true Paul Hackett opening stylee, a hot sunny day greeted the visiting Twyford team to the
      Shinfield rec.
      <p>
      Early caution (not normally exhibited when he's batting) was shown by
      one Twyford player when parking his personalised number-plated DelBoy van some distance from the
      small boundary adjacent to the pitch. Needless to say this caution was unnecessary for him certainly
      and for most of the Twyford batting line-up, as we shall soon see.
      <p>
      Twyford chose to
      field first and openers Beamish and Walkland soon had the home side struggling at 31 for 3, with
      some tight and straight bowling - yes, the LBW down the leg side was completely plumb - Umpire Jim
      said so.....
      <p>
      Then (allegedly) strolled to the crease a County player no less, who
      smashed his first ball for 4 runs and looked for all the world like he was going to score a century.
      However, fate was not on his side that day. Oh no. The next ball fizzed into the pitch, took an edge
      and arrowed fast and low into the Twyford slip cordon. Would anyone see it, let alone stop it?
      Cometh the hour, Kenneth the man, where probably the best slip catch you are ever likely to see (in
      our team anyway) was taken by our Ken, with consummate skill, one handedly, falling to one
      side.....possibly in an attempt to get out of the way. Fantastic!!
      <p>
      Shinfield were
      visibly rattled, but rallied and by the end had crawled to 176 all out, with solid contributions
      from Ahmed and Ali, both of whom were eventually removed with accurate bowling from Green senior.
      Not a bad score, but would it be enough for the Twyford batting order?
      <p>
      Off to a bad
      start, one with 1 wicket down for 1 run on the board. They had some useful (and quick) bowlers for
      sure, with the ball moving around a lot. However, Saint Nathan of Eddy came riding to Twyford's
      rescue once again (as he does on most Saturday's in fact....) and bludgeoned the bowling all round
      the ground. It was a sight to behold, though with wickets falling at the other end in typical
      Twyfordian fashion (the loud shout of 'GAME ON' from the oppo rang round the ground at the fall of
      the 4th wicket) the thought that if Saint N of E got out we might still lose was foremost in most
      minds.
      <p>
      However, stout defending at one end (especially by the Hogster - who had to
      sadly retire hurt and by George 'Nurdle' Nunn) accompanied with stout bludgeoning at the other by
      Nathan brought Twyford CC (well Nathan CC actually) home and dry, with a 6 to reach his hundred and
      to simultaneously win the game (the flash git). I think he got to 50 with a 6 too! A comfortable win
      in the end....a team effort of course...
      <p>
      Man of the match...........ummm.....a hard
      one. I'll think about it.
      <p>
      So a good victory in the end against a side that could
      (and probably) should have done better against us. But, hey who cares! 30 odd points to the good!
