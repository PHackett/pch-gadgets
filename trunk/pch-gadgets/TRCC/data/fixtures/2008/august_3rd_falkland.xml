  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
      A really gloomy day for August, it did not look like we were even going to bowl a single ball. But
      the drizzle backed off, and a reasonable breeze helped dry things out. Slippery for the bowlers and
      batters, but with the application of plenty of sawdust the game could begin. 
      <p>
      TRCC
      elected to field, and their bowlers were given plenty of help from the pitch, what with the recent
      rain. Hackett especially gave the batsmen cause for concern. Although he is a medium-pace bowler,
      both openers elected to have helmets after the first two overs! There was the early dismissal of
      Seth, but after that White and the youngster Piper proved solid. Their stand of almost 100 was
      finally broken by C Fort trapping White LBW, and Fuller dismissed Piper soon afterwards. With the
      overs running out, Falkland began to hit out, but at the cost of swiftly falling wickets. The final
      total of 159 did not look bad on such an ugly day, but Twyford thought it an achievable total.
     
      <p>
      But, after a top-class tea, the weather had other ideas. Falkland bowled only 28 balls
      before the weather turned ugly again, and everyone returned to the pavilion. Hope over observation
      sent them out to the square once more, but it was pointless. The game was abandoned.
