  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A bright blue sky and a hot summer afternoon. Sandhurst (a last minute conference replacement for
      Amersham who cried off on Friday lunchtime) won the toss and unhesitatingly elected to bat. A young
      Sandhurst team failed to hide their nervousness and inexperience when skipper Birch was run out as a
      result of bad calling and poor judgement. A strip of variable bounce and occasionally extravagant
      turn served to compound Sandhurst's uncertainty. The outfield however was glass like and any shot
      piercing the field sped to the boundary. 
      <p>
       Twyford's opening bowlers were not on top
      form although Green eventually settled to a good line and length. Beamish was quicker and his pace
      combined with the variable bounce brought him more rewards from the other end. It was spinner Downes
      however who did most of the damage taking 4-43 whilst toiling under the hot sun in a 12 over spell.
      All the bowlers were backed up with some terrific fielding and none better than by Fuller who at one
      stage sprinted round the boundary, dived full length at ankle height and pulled off a 2 handed stop
      that would not have looked out of place in the recent Ashes tests. Twyford's experience and
      concentration came out on top and the visitors were eventually dismissed 15 minutes before tea for a
      total of 128. 
      <p>
       The target of 129 never looked enough, Twyford had time on their
      side, the fast outfield more than made up for the vagaries of the pitch and there was an opportunity
      to promote some of the usually supporting batsmen into leading roles. This chance was taken by both
      H Fort and Fuller who joint top scored with 25 each. Twyford had batting strength all the way down
      and despite the slow start from Seymour (well he is getting on a bit) the late middle order saw
      Twyford comfortably home with some 7 overs to spare.
