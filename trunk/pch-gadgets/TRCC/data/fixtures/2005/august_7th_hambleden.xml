  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       After the excitement of the morning's test match at Edgbaston, the teams arrived at worn out, but
      keen to try and emulate their England heroes! 
      <p>
       Unfortunately, due a mix-up, both
      teams arrived at their own grounds, both convinced that they were to be the hosts for the day.
      Eventually, an expeditionary force was dispatched and contact established. The toss of a coin
      determined that the match was to be held at Hambledon, and Twyford decamped. 
      <p>
      
      Hambleden looked glorious on a beautiful summer's day. Due to the delayed start, the captains agreed
      to a 30 over game, with Twyford starting in the field. The home team began well keeping up the pace
      of 4 per over. Twyford's bowling helped this, with many extras and less than accurate line &amp;
      length. Not until the 16<sup>th</sup> over were the visitors rewarded with the wicket of Miller,
      falling to Smith's first ball. But the bowling tightened and the run rate did not improve as the
      innings progressed. Good fielding, including an excellent run-out of high scorer Arnold for 48 meant
      that the final total of 128 was far less than Twyford had feared earlier in the match, in fact well
      within reach! 
      <p>
       But if the visitor's thought that this was going to be plain
      sailing, they were quickly disabused of this notion. Accurate, tight bowling taking full advantage
      of the square's slope kept the visitors at only 3 per over for the first 20 overs, and saw the 3
      batsmen returned to the pavilion. 69 to win in 10 overs - Surely a mountain to climb! 
      <p>
   
         Step forward Ken Cochrane. In an extraordinary display of aggressive batting, when all seemed
      lost for Twyford, Ken produced the innings of his career. Sixes and fours flew from his bat
      resulting in the impossible - A win for the visitors with 9 balls remaining. 70 runs came from only
      51 balls, leaving Ken on 64 not out - His highest score the club. 
      <p>
       But we should
      not forget the sporting attitude of the hosts, who were determined to give all members of their team
      a good go in the game when they could have switched back to the less expensive bowlers. 
      <p>
 
           A fine day, demonstrating excellent sportsmanship from all those involved.
