  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       A glorious Sunday, only one of few so far this year, greeted the visitors Woodcote to Twyford's
      home ground. The outfield was short and parched, promising many runs for the batsmen if the wicket
      played true. 
      <p>
       Winning the toss, it was no surprise when Twyford captain Nic Downes
      put the home team into bat. But the Woodcote openers kept things very tight, with movement in the
      air and off the pitch. By the eighth over, both openers had returned to the pavilion with the score
      on only 20. But Twyford's middle order was made of sterner stuff. Fort and Cochrane pushed the score
      on to 81, followed by Fuller and M Morris, all posting good scores. The tail 'tailed-off', giving a
      final score of 184-9. Pick of the bowling was Worsfold, taking 3-38 off 10 overs. 
      <p>
      
      The suspicion had to be that this was too small a total with the outfield as fast as it was. Could
      Twyford defend such a total? 
      <p>
       Woodcote began showing that they though the target
      was well within their grasp, with Topham hitting accurately and aggressively from the off. But he
      only occupied one of the ends, and with testing bowling from openers Hackett and S Beamish, runs
      were hard to come by and wickets began to fall with regularity. Indeed, when Topham reached his 50,
      the score was only 54! But 181 did not seem very distant, and runs kept mounting. However, two
      inspired changes in bowling shifted the advantage towards Twyford. Hackett's second spell began with
      2 wickets in 3 balls, including that of the prolific Topham, and the home team smelt victory. But
      Woodcote did not give in - They were batting to win! Their number 10 Knox sent the ball to the
      boundary with, to Twyford, alarming regularity. In the end, S Beamish dismissed him only 9 runs
      short of victory with overs in hand to bring the game to a close and victory to Twyford! 
      <p>

            Hackett, recording his first 5-wicket haul for two years provided the highlight for Twyford's
      bowling, and Topham with 71 was the pick of the batting for Woodcote.
