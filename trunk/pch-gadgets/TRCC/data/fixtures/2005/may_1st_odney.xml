       And so it begins ... 
      <p>
       Beyond the wildest hopes of the participants given the
      gloomy weather forecasts to be had in the preceding few days, a beautiful day greeted the teams as
      Twyford played host to Odney in the opening game of the 2005 season. 
      <p>
       Upon winning
      the toss Twyford elected to bat, putting off, if only for a couple of hours, the time when the
      winter-atrophied muscles of the home side were to be tested. A great start was made by Cochrane,
      despite a nasty groin strain severely limiting his movement. The 50 was soon up, helped by some
      lacklustre bowling from Odney. But with a change of bowlers, came a change of fortune. The
      15<sup>th</sup> over saw two wickets fall and runs become rare. Knight, with grim determination,
      helped the runs along, and later Dunsford added a valuable 13. Dickie excelled for Odney with only
      13 runs scored from 11 overs, taking three wickets on the way. 
      <p>
       On a wicket moist
      and spongy after the previous night's thunderstorms, the final total of 130 for 8 certainly gave
      Twyford something to bowl at. 
      <p>
       And certainly things started in Twyford's favour.
      Runs were at a premium and, despite a few dropped catches, wickets were falling. By the end of the
      21<sup>st</sup> over Odney were in trouble at 42-4. But the batsmen dug deep, and would not submit.
      There was never much chance of an Odney win, but the held out resolutely against Twyford for a well
      deserved draw. 
      <p>
       All in all, a very pleasant start to what we hope will be a fine
      season!
