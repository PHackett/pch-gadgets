  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       For their penultimate match of the season Twyford travelled to Cranbourne, under the shadow of
      Windsor castle. The day was overcast with a hint of drizzle, and winning the toss Cranbourne
      inserted Twyford to bat. 
      <p>
       That decision was soon vindicated as the Cranbourne
      bowlers made the ball swing violently from both ends. Without much delay Twyford were reeling at
      40-4 with runs coming very slowly. But Captain N Downes held things together, and while seeing many
      other batsmen come and go made a fine 52 before falling to Rezko. The tail also provided valuable
      runs for the final total of 143 - Not a fabulous total but certainly something to give the Twyford
      bowlers an opportunity. Rezko provided the pick of the home side's bowling taking 5-40 off 9 overs.
      
      <p>
       Twyford's openers kept the runs to a premium but without much penetration - The
      first wicket did not fall until the 13<sup>th</sup> over. Still the bowlers kept things tight while
      the runs mounted inexorably until Green was rewarded with 2 wickets in successive balls. Keeping the
      pressure up, the game began to swing Twyford's way with the home side reduced to 59-5. But then
      Cranbourne dug in as Spencer &amp; Driscol pushed the score on before Hackett returning for his
      second spell dismissed them both in successive wicket maidens - Including a caught &amp; bowled
      judged by his team-mates as the catch of the season. 110-7, then 110-8 victory seemed in the hands
      of the visitor's! But resolute batting from the home side was a match to the relentless attack - No
      more wickets were to fall (However a missed catch in the failing light could have made all the
      difference). 
      <p>
       Honours shared then, in a match that swung from one side to the other
      as many times as the recent Tests between England &amp; Australia, the end result being a fair
      reflection of the performances and the sporting spirit in which the game was played.
