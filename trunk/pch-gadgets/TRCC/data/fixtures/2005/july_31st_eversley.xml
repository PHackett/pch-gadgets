  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       An overcast day, warm but dull, greeted the players as Eversley travelled to Twyford for Sunday
      cricket. Twyford captain Edney won an important toss and immediately put the visitors in to bat, a
      wise decision given the heavy rain in the previous few days. 
      <p>
       The opening bowlers
      were accurate, if not particularly testing, but the ball was not coming on to the bat making run
      scoring slow. Walkland drew first blood in only the 4<sup>th</sup> over, and although runs were
      still at a premium more wickets did not fall until a change in bowlers. It was Cochrane who did the
      damage, taking 4 wickets in what has been a difficult season for him, including (extraordinarily to
      his colleagues) a stumping. Fine fielding combined with somewhat lacklustre batting, with only
      Brooks making an impact for Eversley, the final total of 105 off 47 overs seemed well within range
      for Twyford. 
      <p>
       And so it proved to be. Opening batsmen Woodman and Seymour began
      cautiously, but confidence grew as the overs mounted with many boundaries flying from the bat. By
      the time Seymour was out in the 18<sup>th</sup> over a momentum had developed for Twyford. No more
      wickets were to fall, with the victory coming in only the 24<sup>th</sup> over. 
      <p>
      
      The extraordinary season of Twyford, replete with victories continues - Much to the amazement of the
      players!
