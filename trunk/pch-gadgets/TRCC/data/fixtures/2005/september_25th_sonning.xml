  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       The last game of the season, on a day beautifully sunny and warm - Can it possibly be nearing the
      end of September? Where has the season gone... 
      <p>
       Twyford played host to local rivals
      Sonning at their Stanlake meadow ground. Winning the toss, captain N Downes elected to bat first,
      wanting to take advantage of any late, low sun when bowling against the opposition. 
      <p>
     
       Sonning's openers kept a good line and length, severely restricting the runs but not really
      creating many wicket taking opportunities. An excellent ball from Trouton saw the first wicket fall
      after 10 overs, but the run rate kept accelerating. Benjamin had one of his best recent innings for
      the cub notching up a fine 42. Benson and Fuller also provided good support. The final total of 193
      for 6 was certainly not unattainable, but looked good enough from Twyford's point of view. 
     
      <p>
       But it did not take long before Twyford were made fully aware of what the Sonning openers
      were capable of. Racing away, Sohail and Skeil attacked the ball ferociously and accurately. 30 runs
      after 4 overs, 73 after ten, Twyford had no answer to their strokeplay. It took a mere 22.5 overs
      for the visitors to claim victory, with the loss of but a single wicket. 
      <p>
       So, a
      harsh end for what had been an outstanding season for Twyford, but all praise to Sonning who richly
      deserved their victory.
