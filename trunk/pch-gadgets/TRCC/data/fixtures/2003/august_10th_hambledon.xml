       <b>Twyford Coast on Hottest Day</b> 
      <p>
       Hambledon turned up with 8 men and when
      skipper Hollis won the toss he immediately chose to bat. His own form, scoring a patient 91, and
      some help from the Twyford bowlers, made light of Hambledon's reduced numbers. Twyford conceeded 39
      extras including a tidal wave of 25 wides! Steve Abraham was a notable exception bowling an 8 over
      spell in the worst of the heat for 7 runs with only 1 leg bye as an extra. The pitch played like a
      sandy beach with regular low bounce making it very difficult to take wickets and only 3 fell in the
      innings. 
      <p>
       A bone dry outfield shimmered in the heat and a target of 151 was never
      going to test the home side. Woodman found his favourite paddle shot and lapped his way to a first
      50 of the season, Seymour at the other end dropped anchor and dug himself him in so deep that there
      was no getting him out! When Woodman was dismissed with the score on 70 the Twyford lighthouse , the
      6 foot 7 inch, Wren brought his towering form to the crease. He raced, like a jet ski across the
      horizon leaving all in his wake, to his 5th consecutive half century finishing on 64 not out, this
      from an unbeaten 2nd wicket partnership of 85. Seymour who finished on 35 and the large crowd of
      families, friends and daytrippers who had been brought out by the hot weather just sat on deck
      chairs, ate ice creams and marvelled
