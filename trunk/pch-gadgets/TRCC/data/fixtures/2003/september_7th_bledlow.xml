  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Slipping into September, but still a warm, pleasant day, Twyford were put in the field by the hosts
      Bledlow. This quickly looked like a costly mistake as Twyford took the first two wickets before a
      run was scored. Khan came in and steadied the batting side, but accurate bowling from the openers
      Hackett and Beamish saw wickets continue to fall, leaving the home side at 56-6 by the and of their
      spells. More was to follow, as D Evans' first ball dismissed Ish, and Bledlow were soon reeling at
      63-8. 
      <p>
       But Bledlow had obviously been studying South Africa's recent performances,
      and with the tail wagging strongly the last two wickets saw 59 runs added, with fine performances
      from Zak, Spooner and Taylor. 
      <p>
       Twyford thought the target easily attainable, but
      were soon in for a shock as they faced probably the tightest bowling attack they had seen all year.
      Hardly a loose ball was bowled, and this bore fruit early with Mould dismissing D Downes with the
      score on 5. The accuracy of the attack was even more frustrating for his brother, Twyford's Captain
      N Downes, who after some 25 minutes at the crease was out for 0. The visitors middle order then
      collapsed, relieved only by some aggressive strokes from J Fort, and were at one point 40-6. 
     
      <p>
       But just when an ignominious defeat seemed on the cards, Twyford's tail too decided to
      wag! Cochrane put on a steady 24, assisted by first Beamish and then Hackett. The score crept slowly
      ever onward to the target, but Bledlow's bowling did not falter, the last wicket falling with
      Twyford a mere 8 runs short of victory. All Bledlow's bowlers bowled well, but special mention must
      go to Khan who ended with 4 wickets for only 3 runs. 
      <p>
       An exiting end to a fine game
      against very friendly opposition at a beautiful ground, complete with a steam train passing the
      boundary every hour or so!
