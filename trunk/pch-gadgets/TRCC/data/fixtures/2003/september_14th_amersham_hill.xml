  <MatchReport>
    <![CDATA[
       Another Sunday, another day of the most perfect weather imaginable! What a Glorious summer we have
      had. If this is global warming, <em>bring it on!</em> 
      <p>
       Twyford travelled to
      Amersham Hill and were sent in to bowl by the hosts. As the visitors surveyed the excellent pitch,
      the parched outfield, and the short boundaries, they were thinking that this session in the field
      was going to be a long one! 
      <p>
       And the manner in which Amersham raced away at the
      start did not give them cause for much hope. Despite some tight bowling from the openers Hackett and
      Beamish, the total mounted fast with aggressive strokeplay from the hosts, and three dropped catches
      in quick succession. But Amersham were not to have it all their own way. Hackett struck in the
      7<sup>th</sup> over dismissing Headley, and two wickets from Morris had Amersham Hill at 90-3. But
      Amersham were just getting going. The next three wickets saw 119 added to the total before Twyford
      were able to slow (Not stop) the advance. S Bournes was especially effective reaching 84 before a
      close LBW decision saw him head back to the pavilion. The final total of 220 declared was good, but
      on this pitch would it be enough? 
      <p>
       Attacking bowling was the order of the day from
      Amersham, but Twyford's openers were equal to the challenge! 55 was added before the first wicket
      fell, and 144 was on the scoreboard by the time of the 3<sup>rd</sup> wicket, all the low order
      batsmen having acquitted themselves with panache. N Downes and Wren were both just shy of 50 before
      they fell, and Seymore pulled often to square leg with great style. With the score at 168-5, Twyford
      could sense victory within their sights, but as wickets kept falling regularly, the end was getting
      tense. But Morris, in only his second game of the season, held firm and saw the visitors home in the
      38<sup>th</sup> over, admittedly quite a few more than our generous hosts had taken themselves. 
   
        <p>
       An almost perfect day, made especially pleasant by the 10 highly sporting and friendly
      players that were Twyford's hosts!
