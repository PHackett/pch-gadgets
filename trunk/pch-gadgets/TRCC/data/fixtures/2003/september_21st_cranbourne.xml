    <![CDATA[
       The last home game of the season saw Twyford playing host to Cranbourne at Stanlake meadow. Still
      unseasonably warm, there was at least some cloud cover for the first Sunday in what seemed a long
      time. Once again the outfield was parched, giving the impression that the fielding side would have a
      lot of running to do 
      <p>
       And so it proved. Cranbourne elected to bat, with runs
      flowing from the off despite some tight bowling from Hackett and Cochrane. But breakthroughs came
      early with Glew and Castle both dismissed by Cochrane by the time the score reached 21. Munro
      batting number 4 looked especially dangerous, hitting ferocious boundaries before being bowled by
      Hackett off one that came in off the pitch with the total on 42. Twyford were happy with the way the
      game was going up to this point, but Cranbourne's Crick had other ideas. Supported first by R Jones
      and then by Driscoll he hit a magnificent 74. Unfortunately, the rest of Cranbourne's tail offered
      little support, all being cheaply dismissed by Cochrane. Crick himself eventually fell to an
      excellent catch by Hall. The final score of 189 all out was seen by Twyford as eminently gettable,
      <b><em>but more impressive were Ken Cochrane's figures of 8-62, a personal best!</em></b> 
     
      <p>
       Twyford's batting began with confidence, a confidence that was soon to be dispelled. By
      the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> over they were reeling at 39-4, with only Woodman (26) having put up
      any sort of fight. Tom Hall steadied things, but got little support form the middle order - Twyford
      collapsed to 59-7. But Hall kept going, and with help from Walkland and Cochrane the tail wagged
      once more! When Hall eventually fell with the score at 137-9 it looked all over. But remarkably the
      tail kept wagging. Hackett, Twyford's permanent No. 11, kept his head and hit an extraordinary 21 -
      Almost his entire total for the rest of the season combined. And Cochrane seemed determined to top
      his bowling figures with his batting prowess! However it was not to be. A mere 16 runs from victory
      Hackett was caught - The well deserved victory was Cranbourne's!
